## Support for Native TestNG Test Reports

HyperExecute now supports the Native TestNG Reports that offer a standardized and easily accessible summary of information extracted from raw Extent reports per Virtual Machine (VM) at the end of a HyperExecute job.

> Read the [Native TestNG documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-native-testng-report/) to understand how to generate it.
