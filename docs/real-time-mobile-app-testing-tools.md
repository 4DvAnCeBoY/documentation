LambdaTest offers a comprehensive suite of real-time mobile app testing tools designed to enhance the efficiency of your testing process. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to utilize each and every tool.

## Device Controls
The Device Controls feature allows you to simulate various actions on your test device during a testing session, enabling comprehensive testing of your web applications' behavior in real-world scenarios.

- **Volume Control:** Adjust the device volume directly within your test session to test audio-related features, such as media playback or notifications, ensuring they function correctly at different volume levels.
- **Lock Device:** Seamlessly lock or unlock the device during your testing session without interrupting your workflow. This is useful for verifying app behavior upon device unlocking or handling lock-screen notifications.
- **Shake Device:** Simulate a device shake to test functionalities that rely on shake gestures, such as undo actions or triggering specific in-app events.
- **Rotate Device:** Rotate the device's orientation between portrait and landscape modes to test the responsiveness and adaptability of your web application. This feature helps you ensure your application layout adjusts properly and remains user-friendly across different orientations.

## App Controls
The App Controls feature provides programmatic control over the applications installed on the emulator or real device:

- **Install New App:** Programmatically install new applications on the test device without manual intervention.
- **Kill Existing App:** Terminate running apps to test scenarios like crash recovery, app restart, or handling unexpected closures.
- **Uninstall App:** Uninstall the app to validate installation flows, or clean up the environment between tests.

## Screenshot
Capture high-quality screenshots of the current screen on your test device instantly. Screenshots are essential for documenting bugs, UI issues, and other anomalies during testing. Click on the Screenshot icon in the sidebar to take a snapshot of the current screen and will automatically start downloading in your local machine and it will be saved in the [gallery](/support/docs/real-time-mobile-app-testing-tools/#gallery) as well.

## Record Session
Record your entire test session for detailed analysis and playback. Click on the Record Session button to begin recording. A timer will display the recording duration, helping you pinpoint specific moments during playback. To end the recording, click the Stop button. The recorded video will be saved automatically in the [gallery](/support/docs/real-time-mobile-app-testing-tools/#gallery) for review.

## Gallery
All screenshots and video recordings from test sessions are stored in the Gallery. To access, select Gallery from the left toolbar and you'll find the saved screenshots and videos. To download the screenshots or videos to your local machine, click on the Download icon. You can also mark them as bug by clicking on the Bug icon.

## Mark as Bug
This feature allows you to mark any bug in your UI during the session. You can mark the bug in your UI via different shapes, texts and of different colors. You can also configure different project management tools with your session to create a ticket for the same. You can also share that bug, save the image to the gallery or download that screenshot.

## IP Geolocation
The IP Geolocation feature enables you to simulate website and mobile experiences from over 45 countries by using local IP addresses. This allows you to test localized features such as pricing, languages, and product offerings. With IP Geolocation enabled, you can verify that your app's traffic is coming from a specific country, allowing for comprehensive global testing.

## GPS Location
GPS Geolocation testing allows you to simulate specific device locations using exact GPS coordinates to evaluate location-based app scenarios. You can enter your preferred location by entering the name of the location. However, if your preferred location is not showing, you can specify the exact location by entering the latitude and longitude of the location.

## Files and Media
The [Upload and Download Files](/support/docs/real-time-upload-and-download-files/) feature allows to manage files directly within remote testing environments. This functionality streamlines the testing process by allowing seamless file transfers between local and remote environments across desktop and mobile platforms.

## Network Throttling
LambdaTest's network throttling feature empowers you to simulate real-world network conditions (2G, 3G, LTE) during testing. This allows you to assess your application performance under varying internet speeds, ensuring a seamless user experience across different network environments. You can leverage predefined network profiles or craft custom settings for comprehensive testing.

## Settings
The settings section offer the following features:
- **Idle Timeout :** This feature allows you to set the idle timeout for your test session. The default Idle Timeout is 5 minutes and the maximum limit is 60 minutes.
- **Time Zone :** With this feature, you can select the time zone of your preferred region that align with your testing needs.
- **Keyboard Input** With this feature, you can change the language in your test session for a more localized testing experience.
