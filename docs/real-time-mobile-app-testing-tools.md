## Device Controls
The Device Control feature allows you tp perform certain actions with your device  within your current test session:

- **Volume:** Adjust the device volume directly within your testing session, ensuring optimal audio levels for your tests.
- **Lock Device :** Lock or unlock your device seamlessly during testing sessions without interrupting your workflow.

## App Controls
This provide programmatic control over the applications installed within the emulator (e.g., install new app, kill the existing app, or uninstall the app).  App Controls give you the power to do it all programmatically. This streamlines your testing process by eliminating the need for manual app manipulation within the emulator.

## Screenshot
Capture clear screenshots of the current screen on your test device. Easily access and download these screenshots for future reference or bug reporting.

## Record Session
Record your entire test session for detailed playback. A timer keeps track of recording duration, allowing you to pinpoint specific moments for review. You can click on the stop button to stop the video recording.

## Mark as Bug
This feature allows you to mark any bug in your UI during the session. You can mark the bug in your UI via different shapes, texts and of different colors. You can also configure different project management tools with your session to create a ticket for the same.

You can also share that bug, save the image to the gallery or download that screenshot.

## Gallery
All screenshots and video recordings from test sessions are stored in the Gallery. To access, select Gallery from the left toolbar and you'll find the saved screenshots and videos. To download the screenshots or videos to your local machine, click on the Download icon. You can also mark them as bug by clicking on the Bug icon.

## IP Geolocation
The IP Geolocation feature enables you to simulate website and mobile experiences from over 45 countries by using local IP addresses. This allows you to test localized features such as pricing, languages, and product offerings. With IP Geolocation enabled, you can verify that your app's traffic is coming from a specific country, allowing for comprehensive global testing.
 
### GPS Location
GPS Geolocation testing allows you to simulate specific device locations using exact GPS coordinates to evaluate location-based app scenarios. You can enter your preferred location by entering the name of the location. 

However, if your preferred location is not showing, you can specify the exact location by entering the latitude and longitude of the location. 

## Network Throttling
LambdaTest's network throttling feature empowers you to simulate real-world network conditions (2G, 3G, LTE) during testing. This allows you to assess your application performance under varying internet speeds, ensuring a seamless user experience across different network environments. You can leverage predefined network profiles or craft custom settings for comprehensive testing.

## Projects
The projects feature allows you to track your existing test session in an existing project.

## Settings
The settings section offer the following features:
- **Idle Timeout :** This feature allows you to set the idle timeout for your test session. The default Idle Timeout is 5 minutes and the maximum limit is 60 minutes.
- **Time Zone :** With this feature, you can select the time zone of your preferred region that align with your testing needs.
- **Keyboard Input** With this feature, you can change the language in your test session for a more localized testing experience.
 
## Switch
This feature allows you to switch between devices, browser and their OS versions without exiting your current test session.

## End Session
By clicking on the end session button, you can close your current test session.
