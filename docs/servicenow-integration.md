ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform for IT service management and automating business processes. Integrating ServiceNow with LambdaTest enables you to log incidents directly from your testing sessions into ServiceNow, streamlining your workflow and enhancing team collaboration.

> ServiceNow Integration with LambdaTest is available for both freemium and premium plans.

### Create an OAuth Application for LambdaTest in ServiceNow

> Only an administrator of your ServiceNow instance can create the OAuth application required for integration.

To enable integration, you need to create an OAuth application in your ServiceNow instance for LambdaTest:

1. **Log in to your ServiceNow instance** as an administrator.
2. Go to **System OAuth > Application Registry** in the left navigation pane.

3. Click **New** and select **Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients**.
4. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name:** Enter a name (e.g., LambdaTest Integration).
   - **Client ID:** (Optional) Leave blank to auto-generate or specify your own.
   - **Client Secret:** (Optional) Leave blank to auto-generate or specify your own.
   - **Redirect URL:** <div className="lambdatest__codeblock"><CodeBlock>https://integrations.lambdatest.com/servicenow/auth/callback</CodeBlock></div>
   - **Logo URL:** <CodeBlock>https://www.lambdatest.com/resources/images/logos/logo.svg</CodeBlock>
  <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/integrations/servicenow/2.png').default} alt="2" className="doc_img"/>

5. Click **Submit** to create the application.
6. After creation, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You will need these values to complete the integration in LambdaTest.




Once the OAuth application is set up, proceed with the integration steps below.

## Integrate ServiceNow from your LambdaTest Account
