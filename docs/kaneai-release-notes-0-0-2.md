## 1. Iframe, Shadow DOM, and Canvas Support <FeatureTag value="Web Agent" />
KaneAI now fully supports testing for:

- Iframe elements 🖼️
- Shadow DOM elements 🕶️
- Canvas elements 🎨

We've gone the extra mile to bring full iframe, Shadow DOM, and Canvas support in code exports 🖥️. Now, KaneAI handles these intricate UI elements with precision during script generation, making your automation journey even smoother. Whether dealing with complex nested iframes or shadow-rooted elements, KaneAI has you covered!

## 2. Auto-Scroll for Manual Interaction 🎯 <FeatureTag value="Web Agent" />
No more searching for the latest entries after clicking! KaneAI now automatically scrolls to the latest interaction in manual testing sessions, saving time and making testing more efficient.

## 3. Screenshot Modal Fix 📸 <FeatureTag value="Test Manager" /> <FeatureTag value="Web Agent" />
We’ve fixed an issue where screenshots would appear outside the modal on both KaneAI and TMS. Screenshots will now stay neatly within their designated area for better viewing.

## 4. URL Update with Objective Changes 🌐 <FeatureTag value="Test Planner" />

## 5. Label Overlap Fix in TMS 🏷️ <FeatureTag value="Test Manager" />
Fixed the issue of labels overlapping other elements on the TMS UI. Now, we show a concise label such as "+12" when there's no space. Clicking it will open an overlay with all label details, improving readability and UI neatness.

## 6. Test Case Name Display Issue Fixed 🔍 <BugFixTag value="Bug Fix" /> 
Resolved an issue where test case names weren't appearing in certain situations, such as when the screen was zoomed in at 200%. This fix ensures that test case names are visible even in extreme zoom conditions.
