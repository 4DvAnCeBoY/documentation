- Shadow DOM elements 🕶️
- Canvas elements 🎨

## 2. Iframe-Shadow-Canvas Support in Code Export
We've gone the extra mile to bring full Iframe, Shadow DOM, and Canvas support in code exports 🖥️. Now, KaneAI handles these intricate UI elements with precision during script generation, making your automation journey even smoother.

We've resolved a bug impacting the Linux image within the Test Management System (TMS), ensuring a smooth and error-free experience for users on this platform.

## 4. Auto-Scroll for Manual Interaction 🎯
No more searching for the latest entries after clicking! KaneAI now automatically scrolls to the latest interaction in manual testing sessions, saving time and making testing more efficient.

## 5. View Issue Button on Error Only 🚨
To enhance UI clarity, the "View Issue" button will only appear if there's an error within the viewport. This helps testers focus on relevant issues without unnecessary clutter.

We've added logic to prevent empty planner API calls on the main objective page. This optimization reduces unnecessary network activity and speeds up the experience.

## 9. Label Overlap Fix in TMS 🏷️
Fixed the issue of labels overlapping other elements on the TMS UI. Now, we show a concise label such as "+12" when there's no space. Clicking it will open an overlay with all label details, improving readability and UI neatness.
