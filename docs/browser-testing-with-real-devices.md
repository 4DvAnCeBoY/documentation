# Getting Started with Real Device Browser Testing
***

Real device browser testing refers to the process of testing web applications and websites on real devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers to ensure that the user interface and user experience are optimal across various device types, operating systems, and browser combinations. With LambdaTestâ€™s real device cloud, you can test websites and web applications to ensure they perform seamlessly across 3000 + real mobile devices.

***

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. From the left sidebar, head to Real Device and select **Browser Testing**.

**Step 2**: Select the **OS** and **browser** of your choice. 

>**Note:** Certain browsers might not be supported on certain devices. 

**Step 3**: Select the **real device** of your choice. You can also search the preferred real **Android** or **iOS** device in the search bar.

**Step 4**: In the case of **Android** devices, simply enter the website URL in the address bar.

In the case of **iOS** devices, you can enter the website URL once the session has started. 
 
**Step 5**: Select the **Tunnel** option in the top right corner to test your locally hosted and privately hosted websites.
