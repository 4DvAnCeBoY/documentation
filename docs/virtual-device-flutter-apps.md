Google's Flutter is an open-source tool for developing native mobile apps. It enables developers to create cross-platform apps for both Android and iOS using a single codebase and programming language.

You can now test Flutter apps on the LambdaTest Appium testing platform across 3000+ real Android and iOS devices. LambdaTest supports Appiumâ€™s Flutter driver that lets you test Flutter apps using the Appium framework. To test Flutter apps, you will need to upload apps on LambdaTest cloud servers and then run your automated tests. 

## Prerequisites

Before automating Flutter apps using Appium, make sure you have the following things configured.
- Your Flutter App must be compiled in `debug` or `profile` mode, as  Appium Flutter Driver does not support Flutter App running in release mode. 
- Add the below dependencies in Flutter app's `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  test: Demo
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_driver:
    sdk: flutter
```

- In `main.dart` file, ensure the app has `enableFlutterDriverExtension()` enabled before `runApp`.

```javascript
void main() {
  enableFlutterDriverExtension();
  init();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
 ```

- Set the `automationName` capability to `flutter` in Appium desired capabilities.

```javascript
desiredCapabilities.setCapability("automationName", "flutter");
```

Shown below is the test script for automating Flutter apps on LambdaTest platform.

```javascript
import os

from appium.webdriver import Remote
from appium_flutter_finder.flutter_finder import FlutterElement, FlutterFinder

driver = Remote('http://LT_USERNAME:LT_ACCESS_KEY@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub/', dict(
  platformName='Android',
  automationName='flutter',
  platformVersion='11',
  deviceName='Google Pixel 4',
  app='<App URL>',
  isRealMobile=false
))

finder = FlutterFinder()

text_finder = finder.by_text('You have pushed the button this many times:')
text_element = FlutterElement(driver, text_finder)
print(text_element.text)

key_finder = finder.by_value_key("next_route_key")
goto_next_route_element = FlutterElement(driver, key_finder)
print(goto_next_route_element.text)
goto_next_route_element.click()

back_finder = finder.page_back()
back_element = FlutterElement(driver, back_finder)
back_element.click()

tooltip_finder = finder.by_tooltip("Increment")
driver.execute_script('flutter:waitFor', tooltip_finder, 100)

floating_button_element = FlutterElement(driver, tooltip_finder)
floating_button_element.click()

counter_finder = finder.by_value_key("counter")
counter_element = FlutterElement(driver, counter_finder)
print(counter_element.text)
```
