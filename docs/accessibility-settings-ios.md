Accessibility testing ensures that mobile applications and web content are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. On iOS devices, this involves testing various accessibility features like text size adjustments, contrast settings, and motion reduction.

This document outlines the requirements and testing procedures for accessibility features in iOS applications and mobile browsers. These features ensure that applications are usable by individuals with various accessibility needs.

## Accessibility Settings
The following features are essential to test when ensuring accessibility for mobile apps and web content on iOS devices:

### Text Size Adjustment
- **Requirements :** Implementation of a dropdown menu with size options or a slider control for the text size.
- **Functionality :**
    - **1. Real-time Updates :**
        - Text size changes must apply immediately
        - All text elements should scale proportionally
        - No application restart required
    - **2. Visual Feedback :**
        - Loading indicator must display during backend updates
        - Success notification required after completion
- **Testing Checklist :**
    - ✅ Control interface is easily accessible
    - ✅ Text scaling occurs in real-time
    - ✅ Loading animation displays during updates
    - ✅ Success notification appears after completion
    - ✅ All application text responds to size changes
    - ✅ No text overlap or truncation occurs

### Contrast Adjustment
- **Requirements :** Implementation of a high-contrast mode toggle and Binary selection (normal/high contrast)
- **Functionality :**
    - **1. Toggle Implementation :**
        - Single switch interface
        - Clear visual indication of current state
    - **2. Real-time Updates :**
        - Immediate contrast changes
        - System-wide application within the app
    - **3. Visual Feedback :**
        - Loading indicator during backend processing
        - Success notification upon completion
- **Testing Checklist :**
    - ✅ Toggle is accessible and clearly labeled
    - ✅ Contrast changes apply immediately
    - ✅ Loading animation displays during processing
    - ✅ Success notification appears after completion
    - ✅ All UI elements reflect contrast changes
    - ✅ Text remains readable in both states

### Reduce Motion
- **Requirements :** Implementation of motion reduction toggle and integration with iOS accessibility settings.
- **Functionality :**
    - **1. Motion Control :**
        - Single toggle interface
        - Simplified animation transitions
        - Reduced motion alternatives
    - **2. Visual Feedback :**
        - Success notification upon setting update
- **Testing Checklist :**
    - ✅ Toggle is accessible and functional
    - ✅ Animations are simplified when enabled
    - ✅ Transitions use motion-reduced alternatives
    - ✅ Success notification appears after toggle
    - ✅ Settings persist across app sessions
    - ✅ No jarring visual effects present
## Conclusion
Testing these accessibility features on iOS devices ensures that mobile apps and web content are inclusive and user-friendly for individuals with various accessibility needs. Implementing real-time changes, visual feedback (loaders/animations), and notifications for updates enhances the user experience and compliance with accessibility standards.
