Location-specific behavior is crucial to ensure your mobile apps and websites deliver accurate and localized experiences to users worldwide. Whether it's testing region-based content, geo-restricted features, or local SEO implementations, manually simulating different geolocations is essential for a robust QA process.

LambdaTest's Geolocation Simulation feature allows you to manually set and update the GPS location on real Android devices during live app testing sessions. This empowers you to verify how your app behaves for users across various regionsâ€”without needing to physically move devices or use external GPS spoofing tools.


## Update Geolocation for Real Devices on LambdaTest

**Step 1:** Click on the **Real Devices** > **App Testing**

**Step 2:** Select your required device and upload your application and click on Start button.

**Step 3:** Once your live session begins, click the **IP Geolocation** option from the top toolbar.
