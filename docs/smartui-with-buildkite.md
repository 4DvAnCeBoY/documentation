Buildkite is a hybrid CI/CD platform that allows you to run builds in your own infrastructure, alongside cloud-based execution. This means you can leverage the power of your existing machines or cloud resources to run builds.

This guide explains how to integrate your project with the Buildkite CI/CD pipeline to trigger visual regression testing with LambdaTest SmartUI whenever changes are made to your repository.

## Steps to Integrate Buildkite Pipeline with SmartUI
To integrate Buildkite Pipeline with SmartUI, follow the below steps. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

:::tip Sample repo
Download or Clone the code sample from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the SmartUI.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Repository
Ensure your project is hosted in GitHub, or any supported repository.

### Step 2: Create a New Pipeline:

- Navigate to Pipelines in your Buildkite project.
- Select New Pipeline and connect your repository.

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

Go to Pipeline Settings > Variables. Add the following variables:
- `LT_USERNAME`: Your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY`: Your LambdaTest access key.

### Step 4: Setup your Workflow

```yaml title="pipeline.yml"
steps:
  - label: "SmartUI Tests"
    agents:
      queue: "default"
    env:
      LT_USERNAME: "${LT_USERNAME}"
      LT_ACCESS_KEY: "${LT_ACCESS_KEY}"
    commands:
      - echo "Checking out code"
      - git clone <REPO_URL>
      - cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
      - echo "Installing SmartUI CLI"
      - npm install @lambdatest/smartui-cli
      - echo "Running SmartUI tests"
      - npx smartui --version
      - npx smartui config:create smartui-web.json
      - npx smartui --config smartui-web.json exec -- mvn --quiet test -D suite=sdk-cloud.xml
```

### Step 5: Check the output

- After triggering the workflow, check your results in the [Smart UI Dashboard](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/projects)
