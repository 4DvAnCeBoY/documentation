## Local Selenium Driver Support 🧑‍💻

HyperExecute now natively supports local Selenium drivers. This means you can run your tests without having to set up and use a remote Webdriver. This simplifies the setup process and can improve test execution performance.

> 📕 Refer to the detailed [documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-run-tests-using-local-selenium-drivers/).

## Playwright Real Device Support 📲
HyperExecute now supports running Playwright tests on real devices. This allows you to test your web applications on actual devices, ensuring they function correctly in real-world scenarios.

> 📘 Read the [documentation](/support/docs/playwright-real-device-on-hyperexecute/) to understand the step-by-step guidance.

## Smart UI Testing in HyperExecute using Playwright

HyperExecute now supports integration with SmartUI for your Playwright tests. This allows you to use SmartUI's visual verification capabilities to ensure that your web applications are visually consistent and functional.

> :green_book: Check the [documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-smart-ui-test-using-playwright/) to trigger your tests.
