# Test Case Repository

A test case repository serves as a centralized location for all test cases within a project. Users can access this repository to view a comprehensive list of test cases associated with the project. 

**Navigating the Test Case Repository**

1. Within your project, navigate to the test cases section to view the repository. It offers search and filter capabilities, allowing for efficient location of specific test cases. Utilize the search bar and filter options to locate the desired test cases easily.

2. By clicking on **Status** you can filter test cases by their current state - Draft, Open or Closed.
