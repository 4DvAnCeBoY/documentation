# Test Case Repository

A test case repository serves as a centralized location for all test cases within a project. Users can access this repository to view a comprehensive list of test cases associated with the project. 

**Navigating the Test Case Repository**

1. Within your project, go to the test cases section to view the repository.

2. It offers search and filter capabilities, enabling users to efficiently locate specific test cases. Use the search bar and filter options to locate specific test cases based on keywords such as status, creator, tags. This functionality enhances user productivity by quickly narrowing down the relevant test cases.

3. From the repository, you can view, edit, delete and filter test cases.
