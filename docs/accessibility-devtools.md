LambdaTest Accessibility DevTools is a browser extension designed to help developers and testers identify and resolve accessibility issues within web applications. It simplifies the process of ensuring your website is usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

## Key Features

- **Accessibility Scanning:** The DevTools can scan entire web pages (full page scan), specific website elements (partial page scan), or even multiple pages simultaneously (multi-page scan) to identify accessibility violations.
- **Compliance with Standards:** The scanning process is powered by Axe-core, a popular accessibility testing engine, and helps ensure your website adheres to accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
- **Detailed Reporting:** After a scan, the DevTools generate a comprehensive report that details all identified accessibility issues. This report includes the severity level (critical, serious, or minor) of each issue, along with a clear explanation and suggested remediation steps.

## Benefits of LambdaTest Accessibility DevTools

- **Improved User Experience:** By identifying and fixing accessibility issues, you create a website that's usable for everyone, including users with disabilities.
- **Reduced Legal Risks:** Many countries have regulations regarding website accessibility. Using the DevTools helps mitigate potential legal risks associated with non-compliance.
- **Enhanced SEO:** Accessible websites tend to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) as search engines consider accessibility a factor.
