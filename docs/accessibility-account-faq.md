### How can I enable accessibility for my account/organization?
Accessibility testing is a premium feature that requires activation. To enable it, contact our sales team through our [website](https://www.lambdatest.com/accessibility-automation) or your account manager. They will provide you with pricing details and plan options. Once you've chosen a plan, our team will activate the feature for your account. You'll then have immediate access to our suite of accessibility testing tools.

### How many accessibility automation scans does one organization get?
We offer unlimited accessibility automation scans with our paid plans. This means:

- No restrictions on the number of pages you can scan.
- No limitations on the number of parallel tests or threads you can run.
- Freedom to conduct as many scans as needed for thorough accessibility testing.

### Why is it showing a sub-version (e.g., 1.41.3) even though I have selected WCAG 2.1 AA?
WCAG 2.1 AA is the overall accessibility standard you've selected for testing. The sub-versions (like 1.4.1 or 1.1.1) are specific guidelines within that standard. These sub-versions represent individual success criteria that fall under WCAG 2.1 AA. While you test against the broader WCAG 2.1 AA standard, the results show compliance with these more specific guidelines to provide detailed insights into your site's accessibility.

### Is it possible to scan private or non-public websites?
Yes, our system is fully capable of scanning private or non-public websites. We offer two methods:

- **DevTools:** For quick scans of authenticated pages.
- **Accessibility Automation:** For more comprehensive testing.
Both methods utilize secure tunneling technology, allowing our tools to access your private sites safely without compromising security. This ensures that even your most sensitive web applications can undergo thorough accessibility testing.
