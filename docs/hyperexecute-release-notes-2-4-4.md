## HyperExecute now integrates with k6 for Scalable Performance Testing

HyperExecute now supports k6, a powerful open-source performance testing tool. This integration empowers QA and developers to effortlessly scale their performance testing efforts and gain deeper insights into their applications' performance.

HyperExecute supports all versions of k6 (till 0.52). To use any particular version, all you have to do is mention that specific version in the [runson flag](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#runson) in your [HyperExecute YAML](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/) file.

```yaml
runtime:
    addons:
      - name: k6
        version: "v0.52.0"
```

Also, add these environment variables in your YAML file to install the necessary dependencies for your tests

```yaml
env: 
  K6_BROWSER_ENABLED: true  
  K6_BROWSER_HEADLESS: false 
  HE_CONTEXT_K6_SETUP_DEFAULT_BROWSER_PATH: true
```
