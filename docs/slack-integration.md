Slack is a cloud-based messaging platform designed for teams to collaborate in real time. It offers organized conversations through channels, instant messaging, file sharing, and powerful integrations with developer and productivity tools — making it ideal for DevOps and QA workflows.

The LambdaTest Slack Integration enables users to share or push bugs to their specified channel, capture screenshots, annotations, and issue information.

> Slack Integration with LambdaTest is available for freemium as well as premium plan.
