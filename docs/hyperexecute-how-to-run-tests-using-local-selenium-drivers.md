As a tester, whenever you switch from local web driver to remote web driver can be a tedious and time-consuming process. You will have to manually modify your tests which includes adding Desired Capabilities, and adjusting code just to get them running on a cloud testing platform. 

HyperExecute's support for **Local Selenium Driver** allows you to seamlessly run your tests on our platform with very minimal changes. It will help you in

- **Reduce Onboarding Time :** You can skip the manual code changes and configuration associated with remote web drivers, and accelerate your integration with HyperExecute.
- **Minimal Code Refactoring :** You can now maintain your existing test code, without worrying about the need for significant modifications.
- **Seamless Platform Transitions :** You can run both web and mobile tests (using Selenium and Appium) without platform-specific changes.

## How to Trigger Your Tests?

To utilize the native Selenium driver support in HyperExecute, you need to incorporate the following steps into your testing workflow:

### Step 1: Configure Your Test Suite

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

:::tip Sample repo
Download or Clone the code sample for the TestNG from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

:::

### Step 2: Update YAML Configuration:

- Add the `platformConfig` flag to your YAML file, specifying the platforms and configurations for your tests.
- Use the `platform` flag to define individual platform configurations (OS, browser/device, capabilities).
- **(Optional)** Utilize the `config` flag to set global capabilities applicable to all platforms.

```bash

#highlight-start

  platform:
    - os: win10
      browserName: chrome
      browserVersion: latest
      build: win10
      network: false
    - os: win11
      browserName: chrome
      goog:chromeOptions:

    - os: android

    - os: ios
      deviceName: .*

  config:
    build: latest
    network: true
    console: true
#highlight-end
```

:::info
- For operating system **win, mac,** and **linux**, only the **os** flag is mandatory, rest are optional.
- For operating system **android** and **ios**, the **os** and **deviceName** flags are mandatory, rest are optional.
:::

In the above sample YAML file, we have passed **parallelism = 1** and **total number of platforms = 6**

The number of tasks created = **(total number of platforms) * (parallelism)** = 6 tasks

- 1 windows 10 with Chrome Browser
- 1 windows 11 with Chrome browser
- 1 mac with Firefox browser
- 1 android with any device (we have not specified device name)
- 1 ios with any device (we have not specified device name)

> You can also use **dev** and **beta** browser versions. To generate capabilities for your test requirements, you can use our inbuilt ðŸ”— [Capabilities Generator Tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).

### Step 3: Run Your Tests:

- Execute your tests as usual through your test framework (e.g., JUnit, TestNG).
- HyperExecute automatically intercepts Selenium commands and routes them to its platform.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <your_yaml_file_name>
```

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/knowledge-base/how-to-guide/local-web-driver.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

## Priority Mapping of Capability Selection

HyperExecute follows a specific priority order when selecting capabilities. The capabilities added in the `config` flag are **global** and applicable to all the platforms.

So in the above example, `network:true` capability is applied to all the platform configurations but in the case of **platform win10-chrome** network capabilities will be set as `false`.

| Script Config | YAML `config` | YAML `platform` | Final Status |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
|`"console": info` | `"console": debug` | `"console": warning` | `"console": warning` |
|`"console": info` | `"console": debug` | NA | `"console": debug` |
|`"console": debug` | NA | `"console": debug` | `"console": debug` |
| NA | `"console": debug` | `"console": warning` | `"console": warning` |

## Considerations and Constraints

While HyperExecute's native Selenium driver support offers significant advantages, it's essential to note the following constraints:

- If you are using **IEDriver** in your scripts, the tests wonâ€™t be run on any platform beside **Windows 10**
- Currently **SafariDriver** is not compatible with the following feature.
- Scripts with hardcoded paths for Selenium drivers may require minor adjustments.
- Support for **AndroidDriver** is not yet available; however, **Chromedriver** can be used for Appium testing.
