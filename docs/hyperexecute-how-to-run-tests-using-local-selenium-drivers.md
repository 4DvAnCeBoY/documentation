As a tester, whenever you switch from local web drivers to remote web drivers can be a tedious and time-consuming process. You will have to manually modify your tests which includes adding Desired Capabilities, and adjusting code just to get them running on a cloud testing platform. 

HyperExecute's support for **Local Selenium Driver** allows you to seamlessly run your tests on our platform with very minimal changes. It will help you in

- **Reduce Onboarding Time :** Youc can skip the manual code changes and configuration associated with remote web drivers, and accelerate your integration with HyperExecute.

- **Minimal Code Refactoring :** You can now maintain your existing test code, without worrying about the need for significant modifications.

- **Seamless Platform Transitions :** You can run both web and mobile tests (using Selenium and Appium) without platform-specific changes.
