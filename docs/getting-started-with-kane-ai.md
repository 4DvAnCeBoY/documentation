KaneAI by LambdaTest is a GenAI-Native Test Agent designed to help teams plan, author, and evolve tests using natural language. Built from the ground up for high-performance quality engineering teams, KaneAI intelligently creates structured and contextual test cases by transforming various input formats such as text, JIRA tickets, PDFs, images, audio, videos, and spreadsheets.

Combining deterministic precision with generative flexibility, KaneAI ensures reliable, consistent test execution while adapting intelligently to evolving requirements and discovering test cases that traditional approaches might miss. This dual approach integrates seamlessly with LambdaTest's suite of solutions for test execution, orchestration, and analysis, streamlining both manual and automated testing by saving time, enhancing test coverage, and improving overall quality.

Supporting API, UI, functional, and end-to-end testing, KaneAI streamlines test automation at scale, driving efficiency across modern CI/CD workflows and accelerating the pace of software delivery.

- **Planning:** Effortlessly generate structured & detailed test cases from various format files including PRDs or Jira or ADO work items.
- **Authoring:**  Empower KaneAI to autonomously generate test cases for you, or take full control and write them yourself. In either case, you'll receive automation scripts in a range of open-source frameworks and languages, tailored to your needs.
- **Execution & Scheduling:** Run tests across a range of LambdaTest clouds such as Real Device Cloud, Browser Testing Cloud, Visual Testing Cloud, all via our test orchestration platform - HyperExecute.
- **Maintenance:** Resolve test case updates in natural language or by recording test steps manually, simplifying test maintenance.
- **Reporting:** Leverage detailed test reports for any test run powered by LambdaTest Test Intelligence and Analytics.
