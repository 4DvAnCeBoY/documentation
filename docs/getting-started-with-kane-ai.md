## Real-World Scenarios

### E-commerce Application Testing
Imagine you're working on an e-commerce app and need to verify the checkout process under multiple conditionsâ€”different payment methods, currencies, and shipping locations. Normally, this would take hours of manual test creation. KaneAI scans your app and instantly generates these test cases, covering all scenarios from the most common to the least expected, like handling a declined payment or ensuring discounts apply correctly.

### Cross-Device Mobile App Testing
Consider a mobile app that must work across various devices and screen sizes. Instead of painstakingly writing test cases for each variation, KaneAI handles this for you. It creates and executes tests across different environments, ensuring your app performs consistently across all target platforms.
