Understanding how your website behaves across different geographies is essential for delivering a personalized and compliant user experience. Whether you're targeting region-specific pricing, content, or legal requirements, geolocation simulation is a critical part of cross-border testing.

With LambdaTest’s Geolocation Change feature for Real Device Browsers, you can manually simulate a different country during a live browser testing session—on actual Android devices. This allows you to test how your mobile website responds to users from specific locations without using a VPN or emulator.

## Update Geolocation for Real Devices on LambdaTest

**Step 1:** Click on the **Real Devices** > **Browser Testing**

**Step 2:** First, select the **web browser** you want to test on. Then, choose the real Android device you’d like to run the session on.

**Step 3:** Once the session launches, open the **IP Geolocation** option from the top toolbar.

**Step 4:** Use the search bar to find the country or location you want to simulate. Select the desired location from the results.
