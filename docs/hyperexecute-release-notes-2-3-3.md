## Enhanced Reporting with Multi-Framework Support

You can now create multiple reports from different frameworks for your job. This allows you to:

- **Gain Framework-Specific Insights:** Instantly identify performance metrics and potential issues unique to each framework.

- **Simplify Analysis:** Focus on the results that matter most without sifting through a combined report. Explore framework-specific details and pinpoint areas for improvement with ease.

- **Enhanced Organization:** Maintain a clear and organized overview of your entire test suite. Separate reports provide a structured view, allowing you to efficiently track the performance of each framework.

```bash
partialReports:
  - location: reports/json
    type: json
    frameworkName: extent-native
    email:
        to:
          - johndoe@example.com
  - location: target/surefire-reports
    type: html
    frameworkName: testng
    email:
        to:
          - johndoe@example.com
```
