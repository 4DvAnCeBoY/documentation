# Semaphore Integration with HyperExecute

Semaphore CI/CD is a cloud-based platform that helps engineering teams of all sizes build, test, and deploy their software faster and more reliably. It provides a powerful and flexible way to automate your entire CI/CD pipeline, from code builds to unit tests to production deployments. It is easy to get started with and use, even if you're new to CI/CD. It offers a wide range of features and integrations, so you can customize your pipelines to meet the specific needs of your team and project.

This document will show you how to integrate Semaphore CI/CD with HyperExecute to greatly shorten your test cycles.

## How to Integrate Semaphore with HyperExecute

To integrate Semaphore Pipeline with HyperExecute, follow the below steps:

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

:::tip Sample repo
Download or Clone the code sample from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

:::

**Step 1:** Go to the [Semaphore CI/CD](https://semaphoreci.com/) website and login to the site using GitHub or Bitbucket.

**Step 2:** Click on **Choose Repository** button.

**Step 6:** In the #Job1 add the below mentioned script. Make sure to replace the `username` and `key` with your LambdaTest [UserName and Access Key](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/).

```bash
curl -O https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
chmod +x hyperexecute
./hyperexecute --user <username> --key <key> --config <file>
```

Click on **Run the workflow** button.
