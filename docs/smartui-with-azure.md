Azure Pipelines is a cloud-based CI/CD service offered by Microsoft, part of the Azure DevOps suite. It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications to various platforms.

This guide explains how to integrate your project with the Azure CI/CD pipeline to trigger visual regression testing with LambdaTest SmartUI whenever changes are made to your repository.

## Steps to Integrate Azure Pipeline with SmartUI
To integrate Azure Pipeline with SmartUI, follow the below steps. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

:::tip Sample repo
Download or Clone the code sample from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the SmartUI.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Repository
Ensure your project is hosted in Azure Repos, GitHub, or any supported repository.

### Step 2: Create a New Pipeline:

- Navigate to Pipelines in your Azure DevOps project.
- Select New Pipeline and connect your repository.

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

Go to Pipeline Settings > Variables. Add the following variables:
- `LT_USERNAME`: Your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY`: Your LambdaTest access key.

### Step 4: Setup your Workflow
```yaml title="azure-pipelines.yml"
trigger:
  - '*'

variables:
  LT_USERNAME: $(LT_USERNAME)
  LT_ACCESS_KEY: $(LT_ACCESS_KEY)

jobs:
- job: SmartUI_Tests
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

  steps:
  - task: UseNode@2
    inputs:
      version: '16.x'

  - script: |
      echo "Installing dependencies"
      npm install @lambdatest/smartui-cli
    displayName: 'Install Dependencies'

  - script: |
      echo "Running SmartUI tests"
      npx smartui --version
      npx smartui config:create smartui-web.json
      npx smartui --config smartui-web.json exec -- mvn --quiet test -D suite=sdk-cloud.xml
    displayName: 'Execute SmartUI Tests'
```

### Step 5: Check the output

- After triggering the workflow, check your results in the [Smart UI Dashboard](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/projects)
