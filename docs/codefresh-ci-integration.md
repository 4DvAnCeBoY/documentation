# Selenium Testing With Codefresh CI And LambdaTest
* * *
Codefresh is a cloud-native continuous integration and delivery platform that enables teams to quickly and efficiently develop, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications.

Teams can quickly and easily build, test, and deploy their applications on any cloud platform, including Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS. Our intuitive, easy-to-use UI helps streamline the development process.

LambdaTest now integrates with Codeship to boost your go-to-market delivery. Perform automated cross browser testing with LambdaTest to ensure your development code renders seamlessly through an online [Selenium grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/) providing 3000+ real browsers running through machines on the cloud. Perform automation testing in parallel with LambdaTestâ€™s Selenium grid to trim down your test cycles drastically.

## Prerequisites
***
1. Signing details of Codefresh CI
2. A GitHub repository. Here is our sample GitHub repository for [Python Selenium Sample](https://github.com/LambdaTest/python-selenium-sample.git).
3. **LambdaTest Authentication Credentials**   
    Be aware of your LambdaTest authentication credentials i.e. your LambdaTest username, access key and HubURL. You need to set them up as your environment variables. You can retrieve them from your [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) by clicking on the key icon near the help button.
    

## Integrating Codefresh CI With LambdaTest
***
**Step 1:** Sign-in into your codefresh ci account , and create a new pipeline

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/codefresh-integration/go_to_pipelines.png').default} alt="Sign up on Codeship" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Select your user/git organisation, select repository and then click create.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/codefresh-integration/select_git.png').default} alt="Select GitHub as your SCM" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>


**Step 3:** After the creation of pipeline, you must see the workflow YAML got generated, with your selected github repository.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/codefresh-integration/workflow.png').default} alt="opt for Codeship Basic" width="798" height="415" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** You will have option to choose your runtime image as per your requirements, or test scripts.
  - Choose your runtime image
  - Add your environment variables which needs to be passed to your testscripts.
  - Add your execution command in the commands option of your pipeline YAML.
  - As the selected repository has scripts which is made to run tests on LambdaTest Selenium Grid, you would need 
    set the env variables such as ```LT_USERNAME``` and ```LT_ACCESS_KEY```
  - Then to execute the pipeline, click the ```RUN``` button.

You may take reference from this YAML to run your own test project/scripts
```
version: "1.0"
stages:
  - "clone"
  - "build"
  - "test"

steps:
  clone:
    title: "Cloning repository"
    type: "git-clone"
    repo: "xyz/python-selenium-sample_2"
    revision: "${{CF_BRANCH}}"
    git: "github"
    stage: "clone"

  test:
    title: "Running test"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: "python:3.9"  # Using Python image
    working_directory: "${{clone}}"
    environment:
      - LT_USERNAME=xyz
      - LT_ACCESS_KEY=xyz
    commands:
      - "pip3 install selenium"
      - "python3 codefresh-sample.py"
    stage: "test"

```

You can see the pipeline running.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/codefresh-integration/pipeline_ruuning.png').default} alt="opt for Codeship Basic" width="798" height="415" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** Login to the LambdaTest Dashboard, Navigate to Automation -> Web Automation. You can see your codefresh pipeline build has been executed on LambdaTest

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/codefresh-integration/lt_dash.png').default} alt="opt for Codeship Basic" width="798" height="415" className="doc_img"/>

Similarly you can run test scripts based on any framework using this above described method.
Here is the selenium test script for your reference.

```
import unittest
import os
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options as ChromeOptions

username = os.getenv("LT_USERNAME")  # Replace the username
access_key = os.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY")  # Replace the access key


# paste your capability options below
options = ChromeOptions()
options.browser_version = "latest"
options.platform_name = "win10"
lt_options = {}
lt_options["username"] = username
lt_options["accessKey"] = access_key
lt_options["video"] = True
lt_options["resolution"] = "1920x1080"
lt_options["network"] = True
lt_options["build"] = "test_build"
lt_options["project"] = "unit_testing"
lt_options["name"] = "basic_unit_selinium"
lt_options["w3c"] = True
lt_options["plugin"] = "python-python"
options.set_capability("LT:Options", lt_options)

        driver.get(

        )

        driver.find_element(By.ID, "sampletodotext").send_keys("LambdaTest")
        add_button = driver.find_element(By.ID, "addbutton")
        add_button.click()
        print("Added LambdaTest checkbox")

        # print the heading
        search = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".container h2")
        assert search.is_displayed(), "heading is not displayed"
        print(search.text)
        search.click()
        driver.implicitly_wait(3)

        # Let's download the invoice
        heading = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".container h2")
        if heading.is_displayed():
            heading.click()
            driver.execute_script("lambda-status=passed")
            print("Tests are run successfully!")
        else:
            driver.execute_script("lambda-status=failed")

    # tearDown runs after each test case
    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
