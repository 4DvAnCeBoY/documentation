# Link Jira Issues with Test Manager

Test Manager enhances its functionality by seamlessly linking test cases with Jira issues. This integration ensures a reliable connection between your testing activities and Jira tasks, optimizing project management and collaboration across teams.

### Initial Setup and Configuration

> **Note:** If you have already integrated Jira with your LambdaTest account, you can skip this section and proceed directly to [Linking Jira Issues](#linking-jira-issues-in-test-manager)

1. Navigate to the [Integration page](https://integrations.lambdatest.com/) to integrate your LambdaTest account with Jira. Search for Jira and click on **Connect**.

2. A side drawer will open to initiate Jira integration. Click on **Install** to proceed.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/install-jira.webp').default} alt="Real "  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>

3. A prompt will appear requesting access to your Atlassian account. Click on **Accept** to proceed.

4. Select your Jira instance site, click on **Select Site & Proceed**, then select your preferred project and click **Integrate Projects & Install**.

### Linking Jira Issues in Test Manager

Once the integration is complete, follow these steps to link issues with your test cases or test runs:

1. Head to the issues section in Test Manager, click on **Link Issue** and go to Jira.
> Note: Issue linking is supported in both Test Cases and Test Runs. To link issues, go to the Issues tab within a Test Case or a Test Run.

2. Enter the Jira Issue ID or URL in the input field and click on **Link Issue**.

3. The Jira issue from your integrated Jira Project is successfully linked and listed. You can view the Issue summary, ID, type, status, priority, and creator.
