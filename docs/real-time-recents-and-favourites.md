The **Recents** and **Favourites** feature, located under the Quick Links section, helps users easily access frequently used resources. This functionality provides an easy way to revisit recently accessed items or mark important resources for quick retrieval.

## Accessing the "Recents and Favourites"
The Recents tab displays a list of items that you have accessed recently. This helps you quickly return to resources without needing to search for them. To add an item to your favourites, click the **star** icon next to it in the Recents tab. The "Favourites" tab shows all items you have marked as favourites, allowing quick access to frequently used resources.

- Navigate to the **Quick Links** section in the sidebar of the Real Time Web Browser or App Testing. 
- Select **Recents** to view the list of the recently created Browser or App tests.
- Switch the tab to **Favourites** to view items that have been marked as favorites for quick access.

> You can also re-launch those tests from the recents or favorites section.
