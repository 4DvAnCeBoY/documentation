capabilities: [{
  accessibility : true,                 // Enable accessibility testing
  accessibility.wcagVersion: 'wcag21a', // Specify WCAG version (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level A)
  accessibility.bestPractice: false,    // Exclude best practice issues from results
  accessibility.needsReview: true       // Include issues that need review
}]
```
