## Web Frameworks

### Selenium
Selenium is your go-to tool for cross-browser testing, enabling automated testing across different web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It's perfect for end-to-end testing of web applications. With Kane AI, you can generate Selenium code in:

- **Python:** PyTest is used to generate Selenium Python code.
- **Java:** TestNG is used to generate Selenium Java code.

:::tip
 By default all KaneAI authored tests automation scripts for Web are generated in Selenium Python.
:::

### Playwright
Playwright is a fast and reliable end-to-end testing for complex modern web applications it uses a single API to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. You can generate Playwright code in:

- **Javascript**
- **Python** 

### Cypress
Cypress is a modern web front-end testing tool built with JavaScript Mocha. It operates directly on the browsers without the need for Selenium. Its unique DOM manipulation technique makes it a very developer and QA friendly tool. You can generate Cypress code in:

- **Javascript**

:::note 
Cypress won't be available for test cases where **Switching Tabs** or **File Upload** is present as its not inherently supported by the tool.
:::

### WebdriverIO
WebdriverIO is a popular automation testing framework for web and mobile applications. It is built on top of the WebDriver protocol and provides a simple and flexible API for writing tests. You can generate WebdriverIO code in:

- **Javascript**

## App Frameworks

### Appium
Appium is an open-source automation tool for running scripts and testing native applications and mobile web apps on different platforms like IOS and Android. You can generate Appium code in:

- **Python:**  PyTest is used to generate Appium Python script. 
- **Java:** TestNG is used to generate Appium Java scripts.
- **Javascript** : The code generation for the Appium framework in JavaScript is being rolled out gradually and is not yet generally available.

:::tip
By default all KaneAI authored tests automation scripts for App are generated in Appium Python.
:::

:::note
 For now test runs only work for code generation in Selenium - Python & Appium Python. The support for others will be rolled out shortly.
