## Web Frameworks

### Selenium
Selenium is your go-to tool for cross-browser testing, enabling automated testing across different web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It's perfect for end-to-end testing of web applications. With Kane AI, you can generate Selenium code in:

- **Python:** For Web devices this is **generated by default**.
- **Java**

### Playwright
Playwright is a fast and reliable end-to-end testing for complex modern web applications it uses a single API to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. You can generate Playwright code in:

- **Javascript**
- **Python**

### Cypress
Cypress is a modern web front-end testing tool built with JavaScript Mocha. It operates directly on the browsers without the need for Selenium. Its unique DOM manipulation technique makes it a very developer and QA-friendly tool. You can generate Cypress code in:

- **Javascript**

> **Note:** Cypress inherently doesn't support **Switching Tabs** and **File Upload**, so it wont be available for such test cases.

### WebdriverIO
WebdriverIO is a popular automation testing framework for web and mobile applications. It is built on top of the WebDriver protocol and provides a simple and flexible API for writing tests. You can generate WebdriveIO code in:

- **Javascript**

## App Frameworks

### Appium
Appium is an open-source automation tool for running scripts and testing native applications and mobile web apps on different platforms like IOS and Android. You can generate Appium code in:

- **Javascript**
- **Python:** For mobile devices this is **generated by default**. 
- **Java**

> Currently this is partially rolledout.

For now test runs only work for code generation in Selenium - Python & Appium Python. The support for others will be rolled out shortly.
