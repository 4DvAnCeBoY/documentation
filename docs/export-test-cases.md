# Export Test Cases

Efficient test management is crucial for successful project execution. One of the important features in managing test cases is the ability to export them in bulk for easier tracking, analysis, and sharing with the team.

**Let’s look at the steps involved:**

1. Bulk select Test cases you want to include in the export file & click on the `Bulk Action` button.

2. Click `Export to CSV` present on the appeared dropdown.

3. When you click Export to CSV, you’ll see options to choose which test case fields to include in the export. Select the desired fields and click **Export to CSV** to download the file.

This is how your exported CSV file would look like :

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/mobile-app-testing/exported_csv.jpeg').default} alt="exported CSV "  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="629"/>
This file includes all the metadata fields that were selected during export.
