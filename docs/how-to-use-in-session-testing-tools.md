***

### Home

The Home feature on the left-sidebar allows you to go to the home screen of your selected real device instantly. 


### Screenshot

The Screenshot feature allows you to take a screenshot in an instant of the current screen of the device that you are currently testing on. You can access the screenshots and even download them in the gallery section. 

### Record Session

The record session feature allows you to screen record the current test session inside the real device. As you click on the button a timer would start, indicating the recording time. You can click on the stop button to stop the video recording.

Just as your screenshots, you can find your recorded video in the gallery. You can also download the recording by clicking on the download button.
