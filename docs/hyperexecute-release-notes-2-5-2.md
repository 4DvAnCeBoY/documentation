## 1. Cypress Detailed Command Logs for Enhanced Debugging <NewReleaseTag value="New Release" /> 
**Detailed Cypress Command Logs** in HyperExecute generates an extensive, human-readable record of all Cypress commands and their corresponding results, both in the console and as a file. It helps narrow down test logs, making it easier to debug and troubleshoot Cypress tests.

> ðŸ“• Learn how to enable [Detailed Command Logs](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/cypress-detailed-command-logs/) for your Cypress tests.

## 2. Parameterized Report Email Handling in YAML <EnhancementTag value="Enhancement" /> 
HyperExecute now supports a enhanced approach for managing multiple email addresses within the YAML configuration file. Previously, you needed to define multiple variables for email addresses (`${email1}`, `${email2}`, etc.). With this update, a single variable can now hold multiple email addresses, separated by commas or underscores, simplifying report sharing. This enhancement eliminates the need for multiple variables, making it easier to maintain and modify email configurations.

> ðŸ“• Check the [Reports documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-email-reports/#how-to-dynamically-set-your-email-address) to learn more about it.

## 3. Browser and Selenium Updates for Linux, Windows, and macOS <NewReleaseTag value="New Release" />

The following updates are now live:

- **Firefox:** version 129.0
- **Chrome:** version 128.0
- **Selenium Jars:** version 4.24
