### Additional ADB Shell Commands

- **adb shell ping -c 4 YOUR_URL** <VirtualDeviceTag value="Virtual Device" />

  This command is used to test the network connectivity between the Android device and a specified host, such as `google.com`. When executed it sends four ICMP request packets to the host and wait for responses. The output includes details such as packet transmission time, success rate and round-trip time, which helps diagnose network connectivity and latency issues. The following is a Python sample using the adb command:

  > **Note :** The **-c** is required in this command
  ```python
  params = {"command": "shell", "text": "ping -c 4 google.com"}
  result = driver.execute_script("lambda-adb",params)
  ```


### Enable/Disable Notification

- **enableNotification** <RealDeviceTag value="Real Device" /> <VirtualDeviceTag value="Virtual Device" />

  These commands enable or disable your app notifications on the device based on the value provided for `enableNotification`. **True** is used to enable notifications, while **False** is used to disable them. The following is a Python sample using the adb command with LambdaTest executor:

  ```python
  params = {"command": "enable-notification", "enableNotification":True/False}
  result = driver.execute_script("lambda-adb",params)
  ```

  :::note
  - These commands are compatible with Android versions 13 and above.
  - When you disable app notification permissions using the command, the app go into the background. This behavior occurs due to limitations with ADB, and you need to reactivate the app through test script.
  :::

### Enable/Disable Battery Optimization

- **disableBatteryOptimization** <RealDeviceTag value="Real Device" /> <VirtualDeviceTag value="Virtual Device" />

  This command is used to enable or disable battery optimization for your app on the device. The following is a Python sample using the adb command to disable battery optimization with LambdaTest executor:

  ```python
  params = {"command":"disable-battery-optimization", "disableBatteryOptimization":True/False}
  result = driver.execute_script("lambda-adb",params)
  ```

### Fixed-to-User Rotation

- **fixedToUserRotation** <RealDeviceTag value="Real Device" /> <VirtualDeviceTag value="Virtual Device" />

  This command serves to lock the screen rotation in alignment with the app's default behavior and user-defined settings. Below is a Python example utilizing the adb command to enforce fixed screen rotation with the LambdaTest executor:

  ```python
  params = {"command":"fixed-to-user-rotation", "fixedToUserRotation":True}
  result = driver.execute_script("lambda-adb",params)
  ```

### Disabling Animations on Android Devices <RealDeviceTag value="Real Device" /> <VirtualDeviceTag value="Virtual Device" />
Disabling animations can enhance test execution speed by preventing unnecessary visual effects. The following commands are used to disable different types of animations:

- `adb shell settings put global animator_duration_scale 0`: Disables property animation effects, such as object transitions and transformations.
- `adb shell settings put global transition_animation_scale 0`: Disables window transition animations, making UI transitions instant.
- `adb shell settings put global window_animation_scale 0`: Disables activity window animations, eliminating fade-in or zoom-in effects.

  These commands set the respective global animation scales to 0, effectively disabling animations.

  ```java
  Map<String, String> params = Map.of("command", "shell", "text", "settings get global animator_duration_scale");
  androidDriver.executeScript("lambda-adb", params);
  ```

### Enabling Automatic Timezone and Automatic Time Using ADB <VirtualDeviceTag value="Virtual Device App" />
By default, Automatic Timezone and Automatic Time settings are enabled on the device. These settings ensure that the device updates its time and timezone automatically based on network-provided information. If needed, you can manually enable these settings using ADB shell commands. To enable these settings via ADB, run the following commands:

- `settings put global auto_time_zone 1`: Enables Automatic Timezone, allowing the device to adjust its timezone based on network data.
- `settings put global auto_time 1`: Enables Automatic Time, ensuring that the device syncs time automatically from the network.

These commands help maintain accurate time and timezone settings without requiring manual intervention. If you're using Python with LambdaTest’s App Automation, you can execute these commands using the `execute_script` function:

```python
# Define ADB commands for enabling automatic time and timezone
params_timezone = {"command": "shell", "text": "settings put global auto_time_zone 1"}
params_time = {"command": "shell", "text": "settings put global auto_time 1"}

# Execute commands using LambdaTest's ADB execution method
result_timezone = driver.execute_script("lambda-adb", params_timezone)
result_time = driver.execute_script("lambda-adb", params_time)
```
This approach is particularly useful when testing applications that rely on correct time settings, ensuring they function properly across different time zones.
