- An active test session on Kane AI.
- Supported file formats: PNG, B8EF, and CSV.

## Steps to Upload a File
### Step 1: Initiate a Test Session

### Step 4: File Upload Process
- Upon clicking **Add File**, the selected files are uploaded successfully to the downloads folder within the session.
- These files are treated as variables and their paths are dynamically assigned.

### Step 5: Accessing Uploaded Files
- In the test environment, type upload in the command field.
- Select the required file from the available list using **double-curly braces syntax** (e.g.,`{{IMAGE_ONE}}`).
- Kane AI will detect the appropriate action for uploading and provide relevant options.
- On the right panel, all downloaded files in the sessionâ€™s downloads folder will be displayed.

## Downloading Files from Kane AI
### Step 1: Managing Downloaded Files
- Files added during the session will be visible in the downloads section.
- Users can either download all files at once or select specific files for download.

### Step 2: Reviewing Uploaded Files Post-Test
- After test completion, all uploaded files are recorded as variables.
- These files are also available as attachments in the test summary page for easy reference and download.

The file upload and download functionality in Kane AI enhances test automation by providing easy access to necessary files. By following these steps, testers can efficiently manage files during their test sessions.
