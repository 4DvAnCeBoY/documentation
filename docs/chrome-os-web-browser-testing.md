## IP Geolocation
The IP Geolocation feature enables you to simulate website and mobile experiences from over 45 countries by using local IP addresses. This allows you to test localized features such as pricing, languages, and product offerings. With IP Geolocation enabled, you can verify that your app's traffic is coming from a specific country, allowing for comprehensive global testing.

## Advance Tools

### Chrome DevTools
Chrome DevTools offer a comprehensive suite of features to inspect and debug web pages. Here's how DevTools can help you with styles, event listeners, DOM breakpoints, properties, and accessibility:

- **Styles:** Inspect and modify CSS styles directly on the webpage. See applied, inherited, and final computed styles.
- **Event Listeners:** View, disable, and set breakpoints on event listeners associated with elements to debug event handling.
- **DOM Breakpoints:**  Pause script execution when specific changes occur in the DOM tree for efficient debugging of dynamic content.
- **Inspect & Modify Element Properties:**  View detailed information about each element, including type, class names, IDs, attributes, and JavaScript variable values. Modify properties for testing or temporary adjustments.
- **Accessibility Tools:**  Identify and address potential accessibility issues with the built-in audit tool, color contrast checker, and vision deficiency simulator.
