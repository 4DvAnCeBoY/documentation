# Parallel Testing With Puppeteer
* * *

LambdaTest allows you to perform parallel testing with Puppeteer across 40+ browsers and OS to automate your several test cases simultaneously. You can run one test case across various browsers, or you can run multiple test case scenarios in the same browser with different browser versions.


Shown below are the steps on running parallel tests with Puppeteer on the LambdaTest platform. 

1. Clone the [LambdaTest-Puppeteer GitHub repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample) and switch to the cloned directory.

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample-main
```

2. Ensure you have npm dependencies installed. 

3. Configure your LambdaTest authentication credentials.
