Real-Time Mobile Web Browser Testing is the process of testing websites and web applications on various mobile browsers in real-time to ensure they are fully functional, visually consistent, and optimized for mobile devices. This type of testing helps developers, testers, and QA professionals validate their web applications across different mobile operating systems (like iOS and Android) and a variety of mobile browsers (such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.) without the need for physical devices.

## Launch the Virtual Machine

Navigate to the Real Time Testing section and select **Virtual Mobile** from the **Web Browser Testing** section. To test a website, enter its URL and select your **Device** - Andoroid, iOS, or [ChromeOS](/support/docs/chrome-os-testing/), and its version.

Afterwards click on the **Start** button to initiate the testing process.
