# Getting Started with Real Device App Testing
***

Real device app testing is the process of testing a mobile application to ensure that their functionality and usability is not comprised when installed across multiple Android and iOS devices. With LambdaTest, you can test mobile applications manually to ensure they perform seamlessly across 3000 + real mobile devices.

***

**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. Go to **App Testing** under **Real Device** from the left sidebar.

**Step 2**: Choose the OS version of your choice. ( Android or iOS )

**Step 3**: You can upload an application directly from your system or by entering a valid public URL. Once the app gets uploaded you can select the app from the **applist** or use the search bar to find a specific application. The uploading time may vary depending on the size of the application.

In the case of **Android**, you can install from Play Store or App Center.

In the case of **iOS**, you can install from the App Store, Test Flight or from App Center.

**Step 4**: You can select your preferred region from the **Region** dropdown. Choose from the available regions i.e., North America, Europe, Asia, or select All. If you would like to choose devices from specific regions, please reach out to [support@lambdatest.com](mailto:support@lambdatest.com) to get the option enabled.

**Step 5**: Select the **Tunnel** option in the top right corner (optional) to test your locally hosted and privately hosted websites.

Check out our detailed [support documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) to learn how to activate the LT Tunnel.
