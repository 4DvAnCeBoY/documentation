Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian. It is primarily designed for development teams to manage their code, collaborate on projects, and streamline their workflows.

This document will show you how to integrate Bitbucket Pipeline with SmartUI to shorten your test cycles.

## Steps to Integrate Bitbucket Pipeline with SmartUI
To integrate Bitbucket Pipeline with SmartUI, follow the below steps. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

:::tip Sample repo
Download or Clone the code sample from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the SmartUI.

### Step 1: Setup your Projects and Repository in Bitbucket
- Click on the **Create** >> **Project**.
- Enter your Project details and click on **Create Project**.

### Step 2: Create a New Workflow
- Navigate to the **Deployment** section. Select your required template for CI/CD workflow file. For the demo we are using the Test template.
- Now, write your workflow YAML file. Here is the sample file for your reference.
- Commit this yaml file in your repository and make the required changes in your code to automatically trigger the pipeline.

```yaml reference title="bitbucket-pipelines.yml"
https://github.com/amanchopra1905/smartui-ci-cd-integrations/blob/bitbucket/bitbucket-pipelines.yml
```

:::tip
You can also store your *LT_USERNAME*, *LT_ACCESS_KEY* and *PROJECT_TOKEN* as secrets in your Bitbucket project repository.

### Step 3: Check the output

- After triggering the workflow, check your results in the [Smart UI Dashboard](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/projects)
