## Step 4: Schedule Scan

Once scan configuration and URLs are complete, you’ll be prompted to set your scan frequency and runtime preferences.

## Scheduling Modes

### Quick Scan (One-Time)

* Executes the scan immediately upon creation.
* No future runs will be scheduled.
* Useful for ad hoc validations, staging checks, or one-off deployments.

### Recurring Scan

* Repeats the scan based on chosen days and time.
* Ensures continuous monitoring of regressions or WCAG compliance.

**Fields:**
* **Days:** Select one or more days (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri).
* **Time:** Choose execution time (in 12-hour or 24-hour format).
* **Time Zone:** Select the appropriate time zone (e.g., UTC+5:30 Asia/Calcutta).

### Run Initial Scan (Visual UI Only)

* Applies only to Visual Scans and is enabled by default.
* Triggers a baseline SmartUI screenshot set right after scheduling.
* This is required for future builds to have a baseline to compare against.

**Example Use Case:**
You're scheduling a scan for every Monday. With "Run Initial Scan" enabled, a baseline will be created immediately. This acts as the visual reference for next Monday’s screenshots.

## Modify or Cancel Scheduled Scans

### Visual Scans:

* Access from the **Builds Dashboard**.
* Click the 3-dot menu and select **Edit**.
* Modify the scan name, schedule days, time, and time zone.
* **Options:** Edit Schedule, Stop Recurring Scan, Delete Scan.

### Accessibility Scans:

* Navigate to the **Scheduled Accessibility** section.
* **Options:** Rename, Delete.
* For advanced options like issue filtering and exporting, open the report in the Accessibility Dashboard.
