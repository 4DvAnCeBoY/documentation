## üöÄ New Feature: Enhanced Left-Side Test List View for Cypress
We‚Äôre excited to announce the launch of a brand-new Left-Side Test List View in the HyperExecute Automation Dashboard, tailored specifically for Cypress test executions. This enhancement is designed to provide users with a more intuitive, informative, and actionable interface for navigating and debugging their Cypress automation builds.

### üîç Overview
The new left-side panel now displays a vertical list of executed Cypress spec files within each build, making it easier than ever to:

- Understand the status of individual test files at a glance.
- Navigate between test files quickly.
- Debug failed or skipped tests efficiently.
- Monitor execution time per file.
This feature significantly improves user experience by streamlining test result analysis and accelerating troubleshooting.

### ‚úÖ Key Features Implemented
#### 1. Test File Listing
- Each Cypress spec file (e.g., actions.spec.js, tunnel.spec.js) is displayed in a clean vertical list.
- Files are grouped under their corresponding build for better context.
- Sorted by execution start time to reflect chronological order.

#### 2. Status Indicators
- Green checkmark (‚úîÔ∏è): Test passed successfully.
- Red cross (‚úñÔ∏è): Test failed.
- Yellow clock (‚è≥): Test is currently running (real-time updates).
- Grey icon (‚Äì): Test was skipped or not executed.

‚úÖ Statuses are clearly visible and consistent across both the Build Summary page and individual Test Run pages.

#### 3. Execution Time Display
- Execution duration shown next to each test file.
- Time format adapts based on length:
  - 25s (seconds)
  - 2m 59s (minutes and seconds)

‚úÖ Times like 2m 59s, 35s, and 44s are accurately rendered in UI as expected.

#### 4. Search and Filter
- A dedicated ‚ÄúSearch Tests‚Äù bar is available at the top of the test list.
- Users can filter test files dynamically by filename for faster navigation.

### üß™ Use Cases & Benefits
| Use Case | Benefits |
|----------|----------|
| Quickly identifying failed tests | Streamlined debugging process |
| Monitoring execution time per file | Better performance tracking |
| Searching through long test lists | Improved productivity and usability |
| Viewing real-time test statuses | Enables proactive monitoring during CI/CD |

### üìå Accessing the Feature
This feature is enabled by default for all Cypress-based test executions on HyperExecute. Simply navigate to your Automation Dashboard , select a Cypress build, and view the enhanced left-side test list in the Build Summary or individual Test Run views.
