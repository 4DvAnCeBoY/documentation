While the [Full Page Scanner](/support/docs/full-page-scanner/) analyzes an entire webpage, the Partial Page Scanner provides a more focused approach to accessibility evaluation.

It analyzes specific regions or elements within a webpage instead of the entire page. It is Ideal for:

- Testing specific components like forms, interactive elements, or embedded content.
- Investigating reported accessibility issues on particular sections of a webpage.
- Evaluating accessibility changes made to a specific area.

## Functionalities of Partial Page Scanner

- **Manual Selection :** Choose the specific area you want to scan by highlighting it on the webpage.
- **Targeted Analysis :** Focuses on the selected area and identifies potential accessibility issues within that region.
- **WCAG Compliance Checks :** Similar to the Full Page Scanner, it checks for violations against relevant WCAG guidelines within the chosen area.
- **Detailed Reporting :** Provides a report highlighting identified issues, descriptions, and WCAG references, specific to the scanned region.

## Execute the Partial Page Scanner for Your Website

### Prerequisite

- You have to [setup the Accessibility DevTools](/support/docs/accessibility-testing-install-devtools) in your browser.

### Trigger the Accessibility DevTool

- Go to the **Inspect** panel >> **LambdaTest Accessibility DevTools** of your required website.

- To start the scan, you will have to select a particular section of your webpage for which you want the analysis report.
- You can select any particular section for scanning via two ways:
  - **Element Selection :** You can select that particular element via naigating to that tag from the right panel.
  - **Mouse Selection :** You will have to toggle the **Mouse Selection** to **true** and select that particular element by clicking on the webpage directly.
