# Build Details

Users can quickly review the status of testing via the builds listing interface. It offers a concise summary of the number of test cases that have passed, failed, or been skipped, providing an understanding of the state of the testing process as a whole. This aids in the identification of potential issues and successful validations.

Users can also enhance their testing by attaching test evidence such as screenshots and videos. It provides a visual record for any specific test scenario.
