Full Page Scanner is used to analyze the accessibility of entire web pages at once. It goes beyond individual element checks and provides a comprehensive overview of potential accessibility issues across the entire page content.

## Functionalities of Full Page Scanner

- **Scans Multiple elements :** It analyzes various aspects of your webpage, including HTML/CSS code, images, forms, multimedia, and interactive elements.
- **WCAG Compliance Checks :** It identifies potential violations against relevant WCAG guidelines (e.g., missing alt text, insufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation issues).
- **Automated Issue Detection :** It automatically highlights problems and provides detailed descriptions, pinpointing them directly on the scanned page.
- **Prioritization Options:** It prioritizes issues based on severity and potential impact, helping you focus on the most critical ones first.
- **Integration with other tools:** You can integrate the Full Page Scanner with other LambdaTest features like screen readers and automated checks for a more comprehensive analysis.
