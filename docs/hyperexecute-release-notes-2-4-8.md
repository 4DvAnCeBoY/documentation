## HyperExecute: Set Dynamic Email Address for Report Sharing 
HyperExecute CLI added an enhancement in the [`--vars`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/#--vars) flag providing greater flexibility in specifying email addresses for report and artifact sharing. You can now use a variable to dynamically set the email address used to share reports or artifacts. This gives you more flexibility than hardcoding the email address in the YAML configuration file.

```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
partialReports:
  location: target/surefire-reports/html
  type: html
  frameworkName: extent
  # highlight-start
  email:
      to:
        - "${email}"
        - "${email1}"
  # highlight-end
```

Pass the value of your email address via CLI by running the command

```bash
./hyperexecute --vars "email=xyz@abc.com" --vars "email1=abc@xyz.com"
```
