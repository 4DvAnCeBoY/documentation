Detox is a popular end-to-end testing framework for React Native applications. This documentation will help you run your Detox tests on LambdaTest HyperExecute using your local system setup.

## Run a Sample Project
### Step 1: Clone Sample Repository

:::tip Detox repo
Download or Clone the Detox sample from LambdaTestâ€™s GitHub Repository

<a href="https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-detox" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/icons/github.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/> View on GitHub</a>
:::

### Step 2: Download the CLI in your Project
Download the HyperExecute CLI and copy it into the root folder of the downloaded sample repository.

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |

### Step 3: Execute your Test Suite
From the project root directory, execute the below CLI command in your terminal:

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
  <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
    {`./hyperexecute --user ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} --key ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()} --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE `}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

> **NOTE :** In case of macOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** â†’ **Security & Privacy** â†’ **General tab**.

<br /><br />

You've successfully triggered the Detox tests on HyperExecute. Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status. 


## Configure your own Project

### Step 1: Download the CLI in your Project
Download the HyperExecute CLI and copy it into the root folder.

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |

### Step 2: Configure YAML in your Test Suite
Use the sample YAML below to configure your execution:

```yaml
---
autosplit: true

# Set the concurrency level for test execution (2 devices in parallel)
concurrency: 2

framework:
    # Name of the test framework (raw in this case)
    name: raw
    args:
        buildName: test_demo_1
        deviceLogs: true
        devices:
            - Galaxy S23
        disableReleaseDevice: true
        env:
            DETOX: true
        isRealMobile: true
        mobileDC: true
        platformName: android
        privateCloud: true
        queueTimeout: 600

        # Enable or disable video recording support
        video: true


# Make test status as HyperExecute job's status
frameworkStatusOnly: true

# job label for hyperexecute job
jobLabel: ['raw','detox','public']

# Pre-install required dependencies from pre-setup scripts
pre:
    - bash ./lambdatest/scripts/pre-setup.sh

# Specify the target platform for test execution (Android in this case)
runson: android

# Test discovery configuration
testDiscovery:
    # Command to discover tests from the discovery.txt file
    command: cat ./lambdatest/discovery.txt 
    # Test discovery mode is static
    mode: static 
    # Test type is raw (custom test implementation)
    type: raw

# Command to run the tests using the testRunnerCommand
testRunnerCommand: bash ./lambdatest/scripts/execute.sh $test

# Define the version of the configuration file
version: "0.2"
```

> ðŸ“˜ To explore more configuration options and tailor settings to your project needs, check out the [YAML documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-parameters/).

### Step 3: Monitor the Test Execution

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/Detox/Detox_dashboard.png').default} alt="TestNG HyperExecute Terminal Logs"  width="1920" height="868" className="doc_img"/>



You can click on **View Test** from the **HyperExecute logs**, which will take you to the [App Automation dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build). There, you can access detailed **device logs**, **crash logs**, and **Metadata** for your test. Youâ€™ll also be able to watch a **video recording** of the Test sessions for better **debugging** and **analysis**.
