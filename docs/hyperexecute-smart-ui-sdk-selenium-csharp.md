This documentation will guide you step-by-step to execute the Smart UI SDK tests on the HyperExecute platform using **Selenium - C Sharp**

## Prerequisites

To run the Tests on HyperExecute from your Local System, you are required:

- Your LambdaTest [Username and Access key](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/)
- [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) in order to initiate a test execution Job .
- Setup the [Environmental Variable](/support/docs/hyperexecute-environment-variable-setup/)
- [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/) file which contains all the necessary instructions.
- Login to [LambdaTest SmartUI](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/) with your credentials.

## Step 1: Create a SmartUI Project

The first step is to create a project with the application in which we will combine all your builds run on the project. To create a SmartUI Project, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Projects page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/)
2. Click on the `new project` button
3. Select the platform as <b>CLI</b> or <b>Web</b> for executing your `SDK` tests.
4. Add name of the project, approvers for the changes found, tags for any filter or easy navigation.
5. Click on the **Submit**.

:::info
After creating the project, you will get your `PROJECT_TOKEN`. You need to keep this project token safe as it will be used in the further steps below.
:::

## Step 2: Setup Your Test Suite

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

:::tip Sample repo

Download or Clone the code sample for the Selenium - JavaScript framework from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

<a href="https://github.com/LambdaTest/hyperexecute-smartui-sdk-selenium-csharp" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/icons/github.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/> View on GitHub</a>

:::

### Update the Dependencies

- Add the following dependencies in your `.csproj` file

```cs
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="LambdaTest.Selenium.Driver" Version="1.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```

:::note
You can check the latest version of [LambdaTest.Selenium.Driver]( https://www.nuget.org/packages/LambdaTest.Selenium.Driver) and update the latest version accordingly.
:::

### Configuring your Project
You can configure your project meta information from here, like build name, project name, defining the platform, browser, browser version, your credentials etc.

```javascript title="LTCloudTest.cs"
var capabilities = new JObject {
    ["browserName"] = "Chrome",
    ["browserVersion"] = "latest",
    ["platformName"] = "Windows 10",
    // highlight-next-line
    ["name"] = "<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>",
    // highlight-next-line
    ["build"] = "<YOUR_BUILD_NAME>",
    ["user"] = username,
    ["accessKey"] = accessKey,
    ["network"] = true,
    ["video"] = true,
    ["console"] = true
};
```

### Adding SmartUI function to take screenshot

You can incorporate SmartUI into your custom `Selenium` automation test (any platform) script by adding the `smartuiSnapshot` function in the required segment of selenium script of which we would like to take the screenshot, as shown below: 
  
```java title="LTCloudTest.cs"
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using OpenQA.Selenium;
using OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome;
using LambdaTest.Selenium.Driver;

namespace LambdaTest.Selenium.TestProject
{
  public static class LocalTest{
    public static async Task Run(){
      using IWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
      try {   
        Console.WriteLine("Driver started");
        driver.Navigate().GoToUrl("Required URL");
        // highlight-next-line
        await SmartUISnapshot.CaptureSnapshot(driver, "Screenshot Name"); //utilize this function to take the dom snapshot of your test
      }catch (Exception ex) {
        Console.WriteLine(ex);
      }finally {
          driver.Quit();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Setup the CLI in your Test Suite

After cloning / downloading the sample repo, you need to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

### Download the HyperExecute CLI

The CLI is used for triggering the tests on HyperExecute. It is recommend to download the CLI binary on the host system and keep it in the root directory of the suite to perform the tests on HyperExecute.

You can download the CLI for your desired platform from the below mentioned links:

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| MacOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

### Setup Environment Variable

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="bash" label="Linux / MacOS" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Configure YAML in your Test Suite

You need to edit the `PROJECT_TOKEN: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN"` flag and enter your project token that show in the SmartUI app after, creating your project.

```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
---
version: 0.1
runson: linux

autosplit: true
concurrency: 1

runtime:
  language: dotnet 
  version: "8.0"

env:
#  PAT: ${{ .secrets.testKey }}
 PROJECT_TOKEN: <YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN>

cacheKey: '{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - node_modules

pre:
  - dotnet clean
  - dotnet build
  - npm i @lambdatest/smartui-cli
  - dotnet restore
  - npx smartui config:create .smartui.json

testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: dynamic
  command: echo cloud

testRunnerCommand: npx smartui --config .smartui.json exec -- dotnet run $test

jobLabel: ["smart-ui-sdk", "hyperexecute", "selenium", "csharp"]
```

## Step 5: Execute your Test Suite

> **NOTE :** In case of macOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.

Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 3.

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
  <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
    {`./hyperexecute --user ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} --key ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()} --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE `}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

## Step 6: Monitor the Test Execution

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status.
