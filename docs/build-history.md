# Build History

Test Manager provides users with the build history for each test plan. This feature showcases all the run instances of the plan, providing insights into the testing progression over time. The build history includes the status of each run instance, offering a quick and informative overview of the success or issues encountered during the testing process.

**Navigating Build History**

1. In the test plan section, navigate to the desired test plan and click on the Build History tab. Each entry in the **Build History** shows a test execution instance with details on when and by whom the build was created.
