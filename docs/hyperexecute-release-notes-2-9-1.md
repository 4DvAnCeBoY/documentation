## Support for `customHeaders` in HyperExecute
You can now inject custom HTTP headers into your test sessions using the `customHeaders` capability. This gives you more control over outbound requests made during test execution, especially when working around network security controls like firewalls or header-based access restrictions.

```java
caps.setCapability("customHeaders", new HashMap<String, String>() {{
  put("x-px-access-token", "testuil");
}});
```

These headers are attached to your outbound HTTP requests and can help:
- Authenticate against secured endpoints
- Pass custom metadata
- Work around network/firewall restrictions

> ðŸ“˜ Refer to our detailed documentation, [Custom Headers](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/custom-headers/) for detailed explanation and examples.
