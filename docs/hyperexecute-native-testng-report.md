The Native TestNG Reports offer a standardized and easily accessible summary of information extracted from raw Extent reports per Virtual Machine (VM) at the end of a HyperExecute job.

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to enable Extent Native Reports for your HyperExecute job:

### 1. Generate JSON Reports

You need to ensure that the `emailable-report.html` file should be generated within your test-suite

### 2. Update HyperExecute YAML Configuration

In the HyperExecute YAML configuration, add the following section to instruct the HyperExecute systems to generate Extent Native Reports:

```yaml
report: true
partialReports:
    type: json
    location: <location_of_the_emailable-report.html_file>
    frameworkName: testng-native
```

- Set `report: true` to enable report generation.
- Specify the `type` as `json` in the `partialReports` section.
- Define the `location` where the reports will be stored.
- Provide a meaningful `frameworkName` for the Native TestNG Reports.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, your HyperExecute job will generate Native TestNG Reports, providing a consolidated HTML report generated by TestNG framework. This enhancement allows customers to access comprehensive and standardized reports conveniently at the conclusion of their HyperExecute jobs.
