This documentation will guide you through configuring the Operating System and Browser for your test suite on HyperExecute. We will cover the step-by-step method to implement the configuration for various test frameworks supported by HyperExecute. Each section provides practical examples to help you integrate HyperExecute with your existing automation suite.

You can easily implement it on your own project. For demo purposes, we are using the TestNG sample repository. You can also access the sample repository for your desired framework:

<HyperExecuteSupportedLanguageRepos />

## Step 1: Update the LambdaTest Capabilities in your test suite

## Step 2: Configure your HyperExecute YAML file
