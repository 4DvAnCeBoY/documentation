Robot Framework is a generic, open-source automation framework designed for acceptance testing, acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It is widely used in software testing due to its simplicity, extensibility, and ease of use. The framework is keyword-driven, meaning that tests are written using predefined keywords, making it accessible even to non-programmers.

> Ensure your project is configured with the Robot framework and all test scripts are in place.

## Steps to Generate Robot Reports on HyperExecute

**Step 1:** Configure all the necessary dependencies and configurations to your project.

**Step 2:** Configure the report parameters in the HyperExecute YAML file

Add the following configurations in your YAML file:

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: YOUR_RUNNER_COMMAND --outputdir Reports 

report: true
partialReports:
  type: json
  location: Reports
  frameworkName: robot
```

**Step 3:** Now execute your job by triggering the HyperExecute CLI. You can visit the HyperExecute dashboard to download the report after job completion.
