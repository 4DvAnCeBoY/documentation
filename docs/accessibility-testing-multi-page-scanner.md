The Multi Page Scanner analyzes accessibility across multiple webpages within a website or application, providing a comprehensive overview of potential issues. 

You can use Multi Page Scanner for:

- Testing large websites or applications with multiple interconnected pages.
- Identifying common accessibility patterns and prioritizing fixes that impact the entire user experience.
- Combining with Full Page and Partial Page scans for targeted analysis of specific sections or pages.

## Functionalities of Multi Page Scanner

- Crawls your website based on user-defined settings like starting URL, crawl depth, and exclusion patterns.
- Performs accessibility checks on each scanned page using the same principles as the Full Page Scanner.
- Generates a consolidated report highlighting issues across all scanned pages, prioritizing them based on severity and impact.

## Execute the Full Page Scanner for Your Website

### Prerequisite

- You have to [setup the Accessibility DevTools](/support/docs/accessibility-testing-install-devtools) in your browser.

### Trigger the Accessibility DevTool

- Go to the **Inspect** panel >> **LambdaTest Accessibility DevTools** of your required website.
- Click on the **Multi Page Scan** button to start the scanning for **Accessibility Issue** for that particular page.
