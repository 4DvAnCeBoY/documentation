This document outlines the process of creating and testing iOS apps using Xcode. It covers two methods for creating.ipa files for testing: directly creating the.ipa file or creating an.app bundle and converting it into an.ipa file. The first method involves creating a.ipa file using various export methods, such as Ad Hoc, Enterprise, or Development. The second method involves creating an.app bundle and converting it into an.ipa file.

## Step 1: Create .ipa files for Testing

In Xcode, there are two common methods to create **.ipa** files for iOS app distribution. The first method directly creates the .ipa file, while the second method involves creating an .app bundle and then converting it into an .ipa file.

### Method 1: Using Export Methods

You can directly create .ipa files using various export methods (**Ad Hoc, Enterprise,** or **Development**) for distribution. The App Store type is not included in this method.

**Step 1:** Open your project in Xcode. Choose **Generic iOS Device** or **Any iOS Device (arm64).** for the project's device target.

**Step 2:** Go to the **Product** -> **Clean** to ensure a clean build. Again, go to the **Product** -> **Archive.** Your app will be listed under the **Archives** after the process is completed.

**Step 3:** Choose your app from the list and click **Distribute App.**

**Step 4:** Select an export method and configure the Distribution options as follows:
  >   - **App Thinning:** None
   - Unselect the option **Rebuild from Bitcode.**
   - **Strip swift symbols** is optional.
   - Unselect the option **Include manifest for over-the-air installation.**

**Step 5:** Choose your Distribution Certificate and Provisioning Profile (Automatic or Manual). This will create the **.ipa** file.

**Step 6:** Once the export is complete, you will be prompted to specify the location where you want to save the **.ipa** file. Choose the desired location for saving the generated .ipa file.

You can use the generated .ipa file for testing on the **LambdaTest** Platform.

### Method 2: Using .app Bundles

**Step 1:** Open your app project in Xcode.

**Step 2:** For your Product's device target, select either **Generic iOS Device** or **Any iOS Device (arm64).**

**Step 3:** Go to the **Product** menu -> **Clean** to ensure a clean build. Again, click on **Product** menu -> **Build.**

:::info note
The **.app file** is generated in your Xcode project's **Products Directory**.
:::

**Step 4:** After generating the **.app** bundle, proceed with building an **.ipa** file:

> - Firstly, create an empty directory with the name `Payload`.
- Move the .app file to the `Payload` directory.
- Make an archive (.zip file) by compressing the `Payload` directory.
- Rename this archive and append `.ipa` at the end. This creates an **.ipa file**.

## Step 2: Create an XCUITest Package (.ipa)

Follow the below mentioned steps to create your Test package:

**Step 1:** Open your application project in Xcode. Choose **Generic iOS Device** or **Any iOS Device (arm64)** for the project's device target.

**Step 2:** Confirm that your UI Tests are included in **Target Membership** and the said targets are selected to be built in your **Xcode Build Scheme.** _UI Tests Targets are specially selected to be built at the "Test" build action._

**Step 3:** Click on **Product** -> **Build For** -> **Testing** to create your test package.

**Step 4:** Go to the **Products Directory** of your XCode project to find the generated **.app file**.

**Step 5:** Now, create **.ipa** from the **.app** bundle. After generating the **.app** bundle, proceed with building an **.ipa** file:

> - Firstly, create an empty directory with the name `Payload`.
- Move the .app files to the `Payload` directory.
- Make an archive (.zip file) by compressing the `Payload` directory.
- Rename this archive and append `.ipa` at the end. This creates an **.ipa file**.

This allow you to transform the generated **.app** bundle into an **.ipa** file, suitable for iOS app distribution.

## Step 3: Aligning iOS Deployment Target for XCUITest Testing.

Match the iOS version of your app and test runner **iOS Deployment Target**. If they don't match up, the tests will run locally, but won't be able to run on LambdaTest Real Devices.

To match the version in your Xcode Project: 

- Go to the Project that you wish to build.
- Go to the **Build Settings**, set the **iOS Deployment Target** to the iOS version of your app. This will align the app and test runner to the same iOS version.

To match the version in your Xcode Target.

- Choose the Target of your Project.
- Go to the **Build Settings**, set the **iOS Deployment Target** to the iOS version you want to use in your test.

:::caution Warning
This process will overwrite the **Build settings** at the Project Level to the given iOS version. While using this method, take note that the Targets can be out of sync with each other and the project settings, which will cause the tests to break. You would need to re-build the Project if you change the iOS version for one target output in order to keep all your targets in sync.
