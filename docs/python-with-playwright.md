# Python with Playwright: Running Your First Test
* * *

Learn how to use Playwright with Python to automate web application testing across 50+ real browsers and operating systems on LambdaTest cloud platform.


## Prerequisites
***

>Note: All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the LambdaTest's Repository on GitHub. You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.

1. Clone the LambdaTest-Playwright repository on your system.

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
```

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. A LambdaTest Username and Access key. You can get it from your LambdaTest Profile section. Don't have an account, [sign up for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).

4. To run Playwright tests, set your LambdaTest Username and Access key in the Environment Variables.


## Run your Playwright tests with Python
---

Navigate to the `playwright_sample.py` file in the `playwright-python` directory.

```py
import json
import os
import urllib
import subprocess

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

capabilities = {
    'browserName': 'Chrome',  # Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
    'browserVersion': 'latest',
    'LT:Options': {
        'platform': 'Windows 10',
        'build': 'Playwright Python Build',
        'name': 'Playwright Python Test',
        'user': os.getenv('LT_USERNAME'),
        'accessKey': os.getenv('LT_ACCESS_KEY'),
        'network': True,
        'video': True,
        'console': True,
        'tunnel': False,  # Add tunnel configuration if testing locally hosted webpage
        'tunnelName': '',  # Optional
        'geoLocation': '', # country code can be fetched from https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/
    }
}


def run(playwright):
    playwrightVersion = str(subprocess.getoutput('playwright --version')).strip().split(" ")[1]
    capabilities['LT:Options']['playwrightClientVersion'] = playwrightVersion

    lt_cdp_url = 'wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=' + urllib.parse.quote(
        json.dumps(capabilities))
    browser = playwright.chromium.connect(lt_cdp_url)
    page = browser.new_page()
    try:
        page.goto("https://www.bing.com/")
        page.fill("[aria-label='Enter your search term'] > input", 'LambdaTest')
        page.keyboard.press("Enter")
        page.wait_for_timeout(1000)

        title = page.title()

        print("Title:: ", title)

        if "LambdaTest" in title:
            set_test_status(page, "passed", "Title matched")
        else:
            set_test_status(page, "failed", "Title did not match")
    except Exception as err:
        print("Error:: ", err)
        set_test_status(page, "failed", str(err))

    browser.close()


def set_test_status(page, status, remark):
    page.evaluate("_ => {}",
                  "lambdatest_action: {\"action\": \"setTestStatus\", \"arguments\": {\"status\":\"" + status + "\", \"remark\": \"" + remark + "\"}}");


with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)

```

Pass the below command in the terminal to run the test.

```js
npm run test
```
