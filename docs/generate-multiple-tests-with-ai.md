In this guide, we will walk you through how you can intelligently author test cases with KaneAI Test Planner.  Instead of manually writing test steps or scenarios, you can now upload files of various formats such as .txt, .pdf, audio, video, spreadsheets, JIRA tickets, and more and KaneAI will automatically translate them into executable test scripts.

## Steps to Author With Test Planner

**Step 1:** KaneAI allows you to generate test cases either by entering a prompt in the input box or by just simply transforming various requirement formats such as **.txt., .pdf, audio, video, spreadsheets, JIRA and Azure DevOps tickets**, and more into structured and contextual test cases.

**Step 2:** Once you have uploaded a file or entered the prompt, KaneAI will start analyzing and will start producing test scenarios and test cases relevant to the prompt.

**Step 3:** After the test scenarios and test cases are produced, you can click on any test case and the side modal would appear where you can edit or delete test details

**Step 4:** Under the test details tab, you can find the **Description, Pre-conditions, and Test Steps with Outcomes**, all editable as per your requirements.

**Step 5:** Under the **KaneAI test plan** tab, you can find the AI generated **Test Flow** where each of the steps can be edited and deleted. Once done with the changes, click on **Next**.

**Step 6:** Once done, you can either click on **Create Manually** or **Create and Automate** option for both web and app tests.
