### How many parallel automated accessibility tests can I run?
With our accessibility automation plan, there are no restrictions on the number of parallel tests you can run. This allows you to:

- Test multiple pages or sites simultaneously
- Integrate accessibility testing into your CI/CD pipeline without bottlenecks
- Scale your testing efforts as needed without additional costs

### Can I run tests on mobile browsers/apps?
Currently, our accessibility testing tools are optimized for desktop web environments. Mobile browser and app testing is not supported at this time. However, we recognize the growing importance of mobile accessibility and are actively working on expanding our capabilities to include mobile platforms in future updates.

### Do you support accessibility testing for PDFs?
At present, we do not support accessibility testing for PDF documents. Our focus is on web content accessibility. For PDF accessibility, we recommend using specialized PDF accessibility tools or consulting with PDF accessibility experts.

### How many pages can be scanned for accessibility in a workflow scan?
There is currently no limitation on the number of pages that can be scanned in a workflow scan. This allows you to:

- Test entire websites or large web applications comprehensively
- Create custom workflows that cover all critical user journeys
- Conduct thorough accessibility audits without artificial constraints
However, for very large sites, we recommend breaking scans into logical segments for more manageable analysis and faster results.
