The Pre-Loaded Chrome Extensions feature in LambdaTest's real-time testing allows users to install and use Chrome extensions during your testing sessions. This capability provides the flexibility to test web applications with various extensions, such as ad blockers, password managers, and developer tools, replicating real user environments more accurately.

> The Pre-Loaded Extension is only accessible on **Chrome** browsers.

- **Debugging with Developer Tools :** Use developer-focused extensions like Lighthouse, React DevTools, or Web Developer to inspect your web application.
