***

In this section we will explain how you can setup a sample repo on TAS Cloud and run your first test execution job.

## Step 1
***
1. **Fork** any one of our **sample repos** into your GitHub account. Sample repos : [Mocha](https://github.com/LambdaTest/mocha-demos), [Jest](https://github.com/LambdaTest/jest-demos), [Jasmine](https://github.com/LambdaTest/jasmine-node-js-example).
2. **Create an account** by visiting [TAS Login Page](https://tas.lambdatest.com/login/). (Or [TAS Home Page](https://tas.lambdatest.com/))

  </p>

## Step 2
***
3. After login, **select your organisation** and continue with TAS Cloud.
4. Import the same sample repository on the TAS Portal that you have forked earlier.
5. On the Post-merge settings screen, just continue with the default settings. (You can update these later)
6. Now its time to configure your `.tas.yml`. For this demo repo `.tas.yml` file is already present üëç, therefore just proceed to **Step 3** below.

<p align="center">
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/tas/tutorial/tas-cloud/mode-import-postmerge.gif').default} alt="Select mode and post-merge" width="1340" height="617" className="doc_img"/>
</p>



## Step 3
***
7. On the bottom left corner click **Already have a .tas.yml** and read the instructions.
8. In order make a commit open the **readme file**, make some changes (you can make any changes as we just have to do a dummy commit) and commit them directly to the master branch.
9. Go back to the portal and click on **Understood** to proceed further.
10. You should see a new job under queued or initiating status on your TAS portal.

<p align="center">
<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/tas/tutorial/tas-cloud/yaml-available-make-commit.gif').default} alt="Select mode and post-merge" width="1340" height="617" className="doc_img"/>
</p>

**Congratulations üéâ** <br/>
You have successfully initiated your first job.
Once this job finishes you should be able to see the test results for this job.
