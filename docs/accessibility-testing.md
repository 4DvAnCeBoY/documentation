Imagine you have to navigate a website without a sight, relying solely on a screen reader to guide you. You are trying to interact with an app or a web-app using only voice commands due to limited mobility. Sounds scary!

This is the reality for millions of people with disabilities who encounter barriers when interacting with digital products. Accessibility testing aims to break down these barriers, ensuring everyone has equal access to information and functionality online.

## What is Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing is the process of evaluating and improving web apps, websites, and mobile apps to ensure they are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.

Accessibility testing ensures that your product is usable by people with disabilities. This includes people with:

- **Visual impairments:** Blindness, low vision, color blindness.
- **Motor impairments:** Difficulty using a mouse or keyboard, relying on assistive technologies.
- **Hearing impairments:** Deafness, hearing loss, relying on captions and transcripts.
- **Cognitive impairments:** Difficulty focusing, understanding complex information, needing simpler interfaces.
