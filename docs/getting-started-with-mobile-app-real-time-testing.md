Real-Time Mobile App Testing is the process of testing mobile applications directly on real devices in real time to ensure they function correctly, perform well, and provide a seamless user experience across various mobile operating systems (like Android and iOS). This type of testing enables developers, testers, and QA professionals to interact with their apps as an end-user would, on actual devices, without the need to manage an in-house device lab.

## Launch the Virtual Machine

Navigate to the Real Time Testing section and select **Virtual Mobile** from the **App Testing** section. To test your application, enter its URL or upload your application from your local machine and select your **Device** - Andoroid, iOS, or [ChromeOS](/support/docs/chrome-os-testing/), and its version.

Afterwards click on the **Start** button to initiate the testing process.
