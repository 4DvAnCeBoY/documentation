Dependent tests signify that one test relies on the outcome of another. To achieve this, TestNG offers the '**dependsOnMethods**' attribute within @Test annotations.

For instance, consider the code snippet in which '**SignIn()**' depends on '**OpenBrowser()**,' and '**LogOut()**' depends on 'SignIn().'

```java
import org.testng.annotations.Test;
public class DependsOnTest {
  @Test
  public void OpenBrowser() {
	  System.out.println("The browser is opened");
  }
  
  @Test (dependsOnMethods = { "OpenBrowser" })
  public void SignIn() {
	  System.out.println("User has signed in successfully");
  }
  
  @Test (dependsOnMethods = { "SignIn" })
  public void LogOut() {
	  System.out.println("The user logged out successfully");
  }
}
```

To discover and manage dependent tests using the Test Discovery command, you can use the following syntax:

```yaml
mvn test -Dmode=discover -Dplatname=win -Dframework=testng -Ddiscovery=dependent
```

This command will provide a Test Discovery Result that lists the tests and their dependencies, ensuring that dependent tests are executed in the correct order, such as ["Test1#SignIn,Test1#LogOut,Test1#OpenBrowser"].
