# Insights Dashboard

The insights section provides a comprehensive project level data overview of key Test Manager features, including Projects, Test Plans, Builds, and Test Cases, available at both the project and organizational levels.

- **Total Test Cases:** Provides a count of all test cases created.
- **Manual Test Cases** Number of manual test cases
- **Automated Test Cases** Number of automated test cases.
- **Automation Coverage** Displays the percentage of test cases that are automated.

2. You can filter test cases based on specific date ranges. For instance, you can view data from July 8th to July 25th to analyze trends over that period.
