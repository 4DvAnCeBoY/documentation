# How to Use Testing Tools In-Session?

Mobile app testing is the process of testing a mobile application to ensure that their functionality and usability is not compromised when installed across multiple Android and iOS devices. With LambdaTest, you can test mobile applications manually to ensure they perform seamlessly across all Android and iOS real devices.

Let us get an overview of all the features in our real device instance:

## Comprehensive Sidebar
***

### Home

The Home feature on the left-sidebar allows you to go to the home screen of your selected real device instantly. 

### App Control

The App Control feature offers you the ability to perform actions with your installed application within your current test session. This feature offers a dropdown with options such as:

- **Install New App:** By selecting this option you can quickly install multiple applications in your already running test session, without having to quit and start a new session. Without any installation limit. 
- **Kill App:** By selecting this option, you can easily kill all your installed applications. 
- **Uninstall App:** By selecting this option, you can easily uninstall all the installed applications. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/app-controls.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

### Screenshot

The Screenshot feature allows you to take a screenshot of the current screen of the device that you are currently testing on. You can access the screenshots and even download them in the gallery section. 

### Record Session

The record session feature allows you to screen record the current test session inside the real device. As you click on the button a timer would start running to indicate the recording time. You can click on the stop button to stop the video recording.

Just as your screenshots, you can find your recorded video in the gallery. You can also download the recording by clicking on the download button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/record-session.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

### Mark As Bug

The Mark as Bug feature allows you to push your UI related issues/ edited screenshot to your integrated workspace instantly. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/mark-as-bug-app-testing.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

### GPS Location

GPS Geolocation testing allows you to simulate specific device locations using exact GPS coordinates to evaluate location-based app scenarios.

Implement this by using the GPS location feature in your code as illustrated below, where you'll need to input the desired latitude and longitude.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-device-app-testing/gps-location.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>
