Real-Time Desktop Web Browser Testing is the process of testing websites and web applications directly on live desktop browsers in real-time. This testing method allows developers, testers, and QA professionals to interact with their web applications across different browser environments, operating systems, and versions without the need to set up complex infrastructure on their local machines.

## Launch the Virtual Machine

Navigate to the Real Time Testing section and select **Desktop** from the **Web Browser Testing** section. To test a website, enter its URL and select your **Operating System**, **browser**, **browser version**, and **screen resolution**.

Afterwards click on the **Start** button to initiate the testing process.
