# Release Notes 2.1.6

## Improved test execution flow with `alwaysRunPostSteps` flag

The `alwaysRunPostSteps` flag provides finer control over post-step execution. When enabled, this flag ensures that all post-steps within a stage always execute, regardless of whether any preceding test scenarios within that stage fail. This guarantees the completion of critical post-execution actions, regardless of the test execution outcome.

This enhancement streamlines your testing workflow by ensuring essential post-steps are consistently executed, even in the presence of failing test scenarios.

```bash
alwaysRunPostSteps: true
```
