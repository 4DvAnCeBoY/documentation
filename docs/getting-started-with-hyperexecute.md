Welcome to HyperExecute, **an AI-Powered Test Orchestration Cloud Platform**, designed to accelerate your testing process, enabling test automation teams worldwide to achieve an accelerated time to market by providing **JIT (Just-in-time) testing infrastructure**.

If you want to learn more about HyperExecute and how it can enable your team, then you are the right place. This guide will help you take your first steps with HyperExecute, from understanding the basics to running your first test.

<!-- HyperExecute is an AI Native Test Orchestration Cloud Platform, enabling test automation teams worldwide to achieve an accelerated time to market by providing JIT (Just-in-time) testing infrastructure that offers enhanced test execution speeds, smart test orchestration, detailed execution logs and much more. -->

<!-- It requires a [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/) file which contains all the necessary instructions and a [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) in order to initiate a test execution Job. -->

<!-- > Let's understand the [HyperExecute Dashboard](/support/docs/hyperexecute-guided-walkthrough/) together. -->

### What is HyperExecute?

HyperExecute by LambdaTest is a cutting-edge, AI-powered platform designed for DevOps teams and QA engineers to significantly accelerate software testing pipelines. HyperExecute **replaces traditional hub-and-node test grids** with advanced orchestration techniques, **eliminating network latency and optimizing resource usage**. With HyperExecute:

  - **Slash your time-to-market** with parallel execution that distributes tests optimally across available resources improving efficiency.
  - **Make data-driven testing decisions** using historical performance trends that reveal patterns and help optimize your testing strategy
  - **Never worry about infrastructure constraints** with dynamic scaling to handle peak testing demands, running 10 tests or 10,000.
  - **Enable multiple teams using different frameworks** to run tests simultaneously across various environments on same license.
  <!-- -	**Intelligent Test Distribution**: Smart test allocation ensures optimal execution efficiency. -->
  <!-- - **Real-Time Insights**: Access immediate feedback with comprehensive live logs and detailed execution analytics. -->
  <!-- - **On-Demand Scalability**: Dynamically scale testing infrastructure to handle any volume or complexity of tests. -->
  <!-- - **Seamless Integration**: Effortlessly integrate with major CI/CD pipelines and testing frameworks for streamlined workflows. -->

Whether testing web or mobile applications, HyperExecute empowers your team to deliver higher-quality software rapidly and reliably.

### Compatible with All Major Frameworks
