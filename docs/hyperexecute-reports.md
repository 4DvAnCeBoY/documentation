Reports provide summarized job information, including status counts and links to tests. You can generate and download detailed reports at the end of job execution that helps you analyze the outcome of your tests based on your framework. 

:::tip note
Refer to this detailed [Job Reports](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/hyperexecute-job-reports/) page to learn more about the types of reports being offered and how to configure them.

## Steps to Generate and Download Reports

Follow the below mentioned steps to generate the Reports for your desired framework:

**Step 1:** Go to the HyperExecute YAML file

**Step 2:** Add the below mentioned parameters in the YAML file to generate the Reports

- You must set the `report` flag to **true**.
- You will have to specify the **location**, **type** and **framework** associated with your report in the `partialReports` field to generate it. 

```yaml
report: true
partialReports:
  frameworkName: testng
  location: target/surefire-reports/html
  type: html
```
> **Note**: If you do not specify a framework but you do mention the type of the report, then a report of the default framework is created.

**Step 3:** Now trigger your job and go to the [HyperExecute](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs) dashboard.

**Step 4:** Click on the **Open** button of the **Reports**.

Here is the sample report generated.

## Generate Multiple Reports
If you want to generate multiple reports of different types [supported by HyperExecute](/support/docs/hyperexecute-job-reports/), simply add the required specifications in the `partialReports` field as shown below:

```yaml
partialReports:
  - location: reports/json
    type: json
    frameworkName: extent-native
    
  - location: target/surefire-reports
    type: html
    frameworkName: testng
```

## Regex Support for Dynamic Report Paths
You can now use **glob-style wildcards `(**)`** in the location field of `partialReports` to dynamically match nested folders and custom report paths. This is especially useful when your test reports are generated inside directories that include date stamps, environment names, or other runtime variables.

Example:
```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
partialReports:
  location: reports/**/cucumber/
  # location: target/abc/**/pqr/**/cucumber-reports
  frameworkName: cucumber
  type: json
```

Ensure that your Testrunner.java file should have the complete path from where partial reports will be added. Example:

```java title="Testrunner.java"
plugin = {
    "json:target/abc/mno/pqr/xyz/cucumber-reports/CucumberTestReport.json",
    "json:target/abc/its/pqr/abc/cucumber-reports/CucumberTestReport.json"
}
```
