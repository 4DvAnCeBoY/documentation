## Location Support for TimeZone Capability ðŸš€

HyperExecute has released an update for the location-based timezone capability.

With this exciting update, you can now use location names (e.g., "Kolkata") alongside UTC offsets. This empowers you to set precise timezones based on a user's location, ensuring a more seamless user experience.

Previously, you might have needed to use:
```yaml
capabilities.setCapability("timezone", "UTC+05:30");
```

Now, you can simply set:
```bash
capabilities.setCapability("timezone", "Kolkata");
```
