# Build Creation

Builds are instrumental in the execution and evaluation of test plans. From their creation to the assignment and attachment of test evidence, builds streamline the testing process, ensuring a comprehensive and well-documented approach to software validation.

Creating a build in Test Manager is an important step that helps test plan from the planning stage to execution. This process involves specifying a unique build name and associating it with a set of test cases and configurations, setting the stage for a structured testing effort through a user-friendly interface.

**Steps for Creating a Build**

1. Create a build for the test plan by clicking the Create Build button in the test plan section. Alternatively, navigate to the builds section and click on **Create Build**.

2. Choose the test plan that will be executed as part of this build and enter relevant information such as **Build Name**, **Tag(s)**, and select **Create**.

3. The build is now created. Enter details to mark status for various credentials such as **Status** and **Assignee**.
